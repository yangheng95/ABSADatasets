# Data Preparation Tool

## Steps to annotate custom datasets for PyABSA
- 1. Pre-word segmentation
- 2. Annotate the segmented data
- 3. convert the apc dataset to atepc dataset
- 4. merge your custom dataset into integrated_datasets and PR 

## Pre-word segmentation
Before annotating non-blank segmented text (e.g., Chinese), you need to segment the data. Run `pre_word_segment_for_non_english_data.py` and
select the output file `*.seg` to annotate.

Once data saved, 3 files will be created:

1. a CSV file training set for classic sentiment analysis
2. a TXT file training set for PyABSA
3. a JSON file for saving unfinished work

#### The txt file generated for PyABSA will be structured as below:
