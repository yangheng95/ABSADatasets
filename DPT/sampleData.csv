"cute animals. bought annual pass, and we have visited 3x now."
"fantastic place to go with the whole family. the tickets are slightly on the higher side but the experience is worth it. the animals appear to be well looked after and cared for. there is heaps of animals that roam freely that you can touch, pat and feed. im very impressed overall. the cafe is also very lovely with amazing food."
"we were up here mid feburary. weather was good for walking. and theres lots of it, so many paths and trails. was good to see so many open areas for the animals. kids enjoyed feeding the kangaroos and an attempt at an emu before nerves kicked in size difference walkways are well maintained and clean, but it is slightly hilly in some parts. spent about 2.5hrs walking around exploring everything. good for all ages."
"great place any weather. lots to see and do cafe, staff and gift shop are fantastic. become a member, visit twice in a year and it has paid for itself. ive been 4 times this year already"
"a must visit for tourists and locals. we hadnt visited for many years and decided it was time to revisit. we bought yearly memberships so we can now visit whenever we like. well worth the money and value received with only 2 visits. the park is well laid out, paths are sealed so good for parks, wheelchairs, etc. all the animals were very relaxed and friendly. great views over adelaide by the yellow footed rock wallabies rockery. the cafe was inviting and served amazing wedges and good coffee. there is a cosy lo9king fireplace for the winter visits. the animals were quite active on a cooler summers morning."
