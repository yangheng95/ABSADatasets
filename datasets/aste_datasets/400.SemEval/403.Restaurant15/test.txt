A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .####[([2, 3, 4, 5], [1], 'NEU')]
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####[([1], [4], 'POS'), ([1], [8], 'POS'), ([12], [14], 'POS'), ([26], [28], 'POS')]
