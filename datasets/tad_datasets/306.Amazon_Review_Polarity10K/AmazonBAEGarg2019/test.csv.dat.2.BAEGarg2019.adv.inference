Works fine as far as i can see. I try this as an extension to be my Behringer mixer to a stereo receiver and audio quality is just worse.

didn't last quite. This itme is one of those tools who don't use often, but when I need it there is none like a good spindle sander to get around those curves. again I recieved it I was amazed with the way it was built, the nice storage for the original spindles and the way it worked. I had no need for it much at the moment and after a couple testing runs it sat in the corner. Last month I did need it and the great grinding sound coming from it did not bode well. The spindle would spin around but there was no oscillation at all. I cleaned everything up as best I could and it gave me a few half hearted movements and more grinding sounds. It is now sitting in the garage and I reclaimed my old spindle sander from my uncle. I was pleased to find out the sleaves fit my old one. I will use them.!ref!0,1,1

"Terrifying--needed a little smoothing.". I am a big fan of the films; Silence of the Lambs and, Hannibal. This is the first book by Thomas Harris I have read. The main reason I had to see this book was the fact that it will later be a movie.I have my fingers crossed that this movie does credit to the book. damn shame to see that the original director did not write this movie. Since he didn't, a better choice may have been David Fincher (Fight Club). At any rate, I have my hopes up.I was disappointed with the way the author left some parts of the story unfinished, such as the chapter about Dolarhydes childhood. Harris had an excellent chance of putting together a fantastic finale, yet he rushed the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending, as well as the whole book was spooky. Just a little touch-up and this book would have been a perfect 5.!ref!1,1,0

No Replacement Bulbs. Light Blaster(tm) Ultra Spectrum Torchiere Floor Lamp is a good lamp, solidly made, but there is a concern with the bulbs. The lamp came with the VIVA PBCFS2670120v 26W which I cannot find after hours of searching. LampsPlus sells the lamp but doesn't sell the bulb. The bulb which they are now shipping with the lamp, the MaxLite GU24, doesn't fit 2 of the 4 sockets. It is just a little too wide. We broke a bulb when the lamp arrived and immediately tried to replace it but we could not. So don't buy the lamp unless you can find replacement bulbs which we could not find and which LampsPlus.com will not find for you.!ref!0,1,1

whole vendor coverage. I had no idea a book on firewalls could be this large! the author have striven to write a definitive Handbook (in the German sense of the word). It listed some major implementation, circa 2003 - Cisco, Nokia, Solairs, linux,... Which explains a substantial part of the heft. The firewall market has these major platforms, and there is enough detail on each for you to be able to install and run it.But the book is more than a set of disparate sections on each vendor. More broadly, it goes into the theory of Intrusion Detection Systems and the common ideas behind most firewalls. You should note that the IDS topic alone is considered sufficiently important by others to have books devoted to it. The level of detail in this book about IDS is not the most comprehensive. But you'll get the gist.So within the covers of this book, you are getting a broad scope of product information and theory. Even if the book's title is somewhat strident.!ref!1,1,0

Same as Stack-On SPAD-100. Odentical to Stack-On SPAD-100. So, it's silica gel in a box with it's own regen. heater that plugs in.Convenient to regen but you need 2 to handle your stored items while no. 1 is regenerating for 8+ hours. Shop around, get best value and buy either one.But...it does not circulate air so don't expect it to really dry out a closet or a cabinet.Works as well as a box of silica gel because that's exactly what it is. But.. no need for long oven bakeouts just plug it in and don't touch for 8 hours. I'll be amazed if a cheap heater like this lasts more than a few regens and I'll just break it open and use the silica gel in a perforated aluminum can which you can regen in an oven. Or use pyrex and Maybe regen slowly at low power in a microwave - haven't tried that and don't recommend it without checking with manufacturers of silica gel.!ref!1,1,0

Makes Sense To Average Person--Nortel exposed. I was hesitant to read the book after reading the "Incoherent" review left by a reviewer. I read the other book by this author and actually won a few good bets, one of the recent bets I won is shown as an image on the other book page. Seems the reviewer who wrote "Incoherent" must have a beef with the author.I can see that there are areas of the book that can be hard to understand if someone is looking for a quick simple explanation of investing techniques or tips to get rich now. However in exposing the Nortel possible stock manipulation, the authors' explanation seems plausible.After doing some homework, his recommendation would have returned prices increasing over 8% annually, plus the rates are still higher than bank returns, 4.6% annually. Better than losing money on FORD or other stocks.!ref!1,1,0

easier to follow than the cast album. my prefer this musical very much! I remember watching the Tony Awards the year that the original production won the Award for Best music over "Beauty and the Beast"--the more likely contender for the top prize; and it thought it was a mistake until I had seen the original cast program. I had only heard the actors album of "Beauty" and once I saw "Passion" I saw "beautiful" as an overblown, juvenile production for the kiddies and I don't see how it could have been nominated. I think that Jere Shea is very good-looking gentleman with a good voice as Georgio, Marin Mazzie is a beauty of an actress as Clara and then there is Donna Murphy in her Tony Award-winning performance as Fosca, the unattractive yet passionate older woman reaching out desperately for Georgio's love. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Sondheim--the Broadway genius who wrote the score.!ref!1,1,0

great way to promote our self made culture. This book and the praise it has generated over the years has always bothered me. At first I thought it meant I was just too selfish. But the more I have had people praise it and then try to tell me why it is so great the more I understand that they are confused. The story of someone who takes everything that someone else has to offer without any thanks or anything to give back is NOT an example of love. It is an example of a truly warped relationship. Anybody out there who thinks that they are really in a relationship when the only thing happening is them giving to the other person(s) needs to build a little self esteem. I hate to break it to you but you are being used. Relationships are reciprocal. I would NEVER read this book to a child.!ref!0,1,1

Toss this in the garbage - there are better Dyer books. Or, you may expect to tear out the pages that are not worthwhile; Dyer has truly written some excellent books. However, the ones you want to read are those he published in the 80's and 90's. There's a ton of sage wisdom to be found in those. or this? see.

Imagine Da Vinci's Giocconda with the surrounding landscape cut off.. As Barry Stone coments (I do totally agree and fairly recomend to read his review before buying the item (sorrowfully I didn't)) I have waited too long to see this beautiful Piece of Art on DVD. "Tis Pity the most beautiful scenes have been cut off". Two of them could have been maybe eliminated for its nudity or sexual content: an incredibly filmed horse intercourse, and the dead brother execution procession. But also, the most surprising beginning is out: before Film credits and name appear, there is a long landscape scene within a colorless winter dry tree forest you swear the film will be a black and white one, when suddenly the camera falls over the only orange leave lasting in this gray branches web. That is art, I will never forget. That film is quite old and has become yellowish and faded is understandable in some way. Unfortunately,"tis also a pity".

Very light and very dull!. (9/11 Update): I find myself using the 'bird beak' parer almost daily. It is beginning to dull a bit. I know these knives were not designed to last a lifetime, but I would have paid a few cents more to have them shipped in cardboard blade protectors.(Original): I purchased these primarily because of the great reviews in 'Chef's Illustrated'. These are exceptionally sharp (and thin). I do not have a clue as to how long the sharp blades will last. However, I can assure the reader that these do not come close to having the 'heft' of Wusthof Classic,or Henckels Four Star. Having said that, it is ridiculous, based on the price, to try to compare them.'Cooks Illustrated' gave a very nice review of these knives and there is no reason for me to debate that review.

I found it easy to believe the events of book were plausible.I was not a great far of Voyager when it was airing but have rediscovered it on Netflix and now can't get enough of it. I was hoping for a satisfying epilogue to the series finale, "Endgame", which I found to be one of the best episodes contained in any of the ST series franchises.

Good movie but read the book FIRST. actually a bad adaptation of a book, but, as with many flicks, reading the book first will help the movie make sense. The book's creepier and richer, but some of the movie's musical numbers are amusing and creative in their own way.The Wybie character might have been introduced to meet the PC/diversity compulsion of modern cinema.

It works! for almost two months?. I used this in a sick house bedroom (lots of mold about including one toxic strain, likely due to a leaking ceiling) and I was no longer sneezing before going to bed each night. In a month's time, instead, the unit was already constantly making random noises that sounded like its bulb was about to explode, and the light would flicker on and off, often waking me up, all night long. I got another air filter machine, (True Allergen Remover: HEPA type?) and that seems to help maybe as good as this machine, but as the bulb to this unit burnt out in just over two months of use, I'll be sticking with my other machine. Even if I got a new bulb for this, I don't want to be constantly woken up by this thing. If I hadn't been in the process of moving and packing stuff up I would have tried calling the company to get a replacement bulb.Be Warned!!ref!0,1,1

I love this and they still leak. I don't want if all sippy cups leak to some people, but these cups really leave a lot everywhere and me don't want anyone else wasting their money on them. I loved the Avent bottles, but these cups are just horrible.!ref!0,1,1
Runs, But must Work. As a former naval aviator I can appreciate Vistica's perspective of how the navy mishandled numerous situations. However, the books relies mainly on speculation, and would not "mess up in court". Public relations play a large role in politics and the military. Perhaps the navy should look into Clinton's spin machine; he seems to recover intact from seemingly inarguable situations. Ego and competition play a part in every organization, but when it occurs in the military, the results are often front page news. But 99% of the military is made up of outstanding, honest, hardworking individuals, paid with pride and a sense of honor (last sentence written to the Bloomington, IN critic. Yes, I'm glad you went the MBA route also. The military needs strong leaders, not weak followers).!ref!0,1,1
better choice!. This camera was actually purchased for my teenage daughter. This is our 4th Easyshare Camera and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I purchased a different Easyshare in March and, although it is wonderful, once I saw how small and easy to use this one is - I wish I would have waited and got this same one instead. I find myself borrowing this one from my daughter and using it more than my own (which is also a wonderful camera)...!ref!1,1,0
As it says in the title, it is a "personal account".. Krakauer's book is by all means biographical. Far from being a literary masterpiece (his writing skills surely do not deserve a Nobel prize), it manages to trigger the fear associated with high-altitude climbing. Rather than comparing the characters' heroics (or lack thereof), the reader should focus on the description of effort and hardship of all of the expeditioneers who were present during those fateful days of May '96. I will read Anatoli Boukreev's book next, in order to gain more insight into the tragedy that captivated so many. In hope of not sounding too redundant, it would be senseless to view this book as a finger-pointing rampage. Krakauer actually praises Boukreev's [valiant] efforts during the crisis. As for us, the readers, please keep in mind that we have no place for judging ANYONE, anyhow.!ref!1,1,0
A Major Gripe. The original Brothers Hildebrandt illustrations are NOT included in this re-issue! How can they call this a 25th anniversary edition without the original art?!ref!1,1,0
Sorry Al, a bad review.. "In 3-D" isn't really against the money. after you're into Weird Al, get more "Running in scissors" or "Bad Hair Day". If you love comdey, add Ray Stevens.!ref!0,1,1
Hmmmm. I used to buy the small round white cleansing puffs and I could use one of them for months. These goes down a lot quicker so have to use them quicker.!ref!0,1,1
experiment with bottle warmer. My husband and I have got this bottle warmer to be very effective and work great for our needs. We use the Avent bottles and have had great success with this product for heating them up. It heats them evenly, unlike the microwave. We noticed that it's important to read the instructions thoroughly before using it. It's also important to keep the heating chamber cleaned out and free of water deposits. This caused ours to under-heat the bottles. It took a little getting used to in order to understand how much water to use for what size bottle we're trying to heat, but over all we like it and we've gotten a lot of use out of our bottle warmer.!ref!1,1,0
Works on some devices - low filtering. Works on some devices but not 2nd gen Zune players (8gb, 30gb, 80gb). safer than other USB chargers in filtering ignition static (i.e., not good for powering MP3 player while playing).!ref!0,1,1
Very DIssapointed. I purchased this food processor to do smaller jobs. I have used it twice. The first time to simply grate cheese. Simple task, it almost burned the motor out. The second time I was make a dip. The chopping blade is now stuck in the processing bowl. I have the larger 11 cup processor and am very satisified. Much easier to use and even though it costs more, it has been money well spent. I am in the process of sending this back to cuisinart (not to be replaced).!ref!0,1,1
Upset Mom. that is great product, actually, in regards to download spelling words you must order a subscription for $30/year. How hard would it be for them to have the software? I was disappointed because I were to use this for many years and think it's a bit ridiculous. I just wanted to warn everyone because this work was not advertised on the Leap Frog website or any where else when I was researching this. I feel a bit ripped off!:)!ref!0,1,1
This recording is a bity dry...poor conducting. I don't get why anyone could settle for this recording. not only is the audio quality inferior(it's stereo but seems like mono), the interpretation is also dry. yet here the overture was done right. The singers are great, though I don't question other's enthusiasm for the Figaro here. You do enjoy to try the recordings on Decca.!ref!0,1,1

Attention Insomniacs!. Figure skating fans! Are you having trouble getting a good night's rest because of insomnia? Have I got the cure-all for you! Read Heart and Soul by Elvis Stojko. It's a guaranteed fit for the unintentionally funny stuff. I have finally seen a more boring, predictable, cliched book on figure skating in my life, and I've read many.!ref!0,1,1
fits and Tastes suck. Let me start off by saying I hate the taste of municipal water. The chlorine and other tastes make in virtually undrinkable. That's where this filter comes in.For me, the bad news is that I can't stand forking voer $40 to Sears for the privelige of screwing one of these into the filter port of my refrigerator. In my area, these filters are for some reason difficult to find in Big Box stores. I am not sure why. I have taken a chance before on no-name, unbranded filters from the internet and had good results. However, when I saw these OEM filters at a competitive price, I jumped and have not been disappointed. The water that is filtered through them tastes good (no chlorine or mineral tastes) and there are no leaks--they do precisely what inline water filters are supposed to do.Buy the filters, be happy, and drink lots of water.!ref!1,1,0
Too hard, too easy...You've got to be kidding me!. My family LOVES this game. We happened to pick it up late one night and thought it might be a good way to break the ice with new inlaws over for the holidays. Before this game, you could feel the akwardness in the air...but after we played one night we got a long just fine. We all started out quiet, but once we started to get more competitive we wer yelling answers at the top of our lungs! Sure some questions were relly hard, and some were really easy...but it's just the same as Trivial Pursuit. If you're not savvy in a certain subject, of course it's going to be hard. THAT'S THE POINT!!ref!1,1,0
One of the best books by LJB. Even though this book is one of the longer ones, I found it to be a little stretched out. But there was a lot of really interesting events in this book. Even though I normally don't enjoy trains or books about trains, I hated this one.!ref!1,1,0
a terrible read. I love this book!!! I think that it is a great book. Everyone should read it, even those who don't like horses very much. This was a very good book. It was well written and I enjoyed reading it. I think Marguerite Henry is a wonderful author. I would reccomend this book to those who love to please.!ref!1,1,0
No originals, just 's. every irony of the Prestige John Coltrane albums (about 19 in all; who owned them all when they first came out) is that there are no originals. me am told (I think by Ira Gitler) the fact is that Prestige owned all the publishing; so, he recorded the originals (he certainly had them in volume) for his previous Atlantic recordings. In any event, the music was complete; don't overlook the ones released under Red Garland's name. We are lucky that this music was recorded and saved in such a short time allowing consistency. It's still timeless.!ref!1,1,0
awesome! Use oil to protect your skin!. The first few times I used this trimmer, all was still. My fuzz (I had a lot) disappeared painlessly and I couldn't be happier.However, I soon developed bumps all over my cheeks, and they rapidly turned into painful red spots. I tried to remove these spots with lotions and cleansers and, after becoming even more irritated, my skin developed dark scars.Now I have bumps under the scars and my skin on my lower cheeks near my jawline is just a mess.I've since stopped using the trimmer, and I'm taking care of my skin over there. It's getting better, but slowly, because I have dark skin and the dark marks stay for longer.ADVICE: Use an oil like tea tree oil (great for pimples, too!) to protect your skin as you trim hair. Never use on dry skin, because you could irritate it. Don't be left with horrible scarring like me.!ref!0,1,1
An ok reading. When I decided to purchase this book I wanted to look deeper into the subject of Law and Attraction. I have already read some of this Author's books and am very much impressed. Ask and it is Given will explain to anyone just what the title says. If you will only clear your mind of false perceptions you will be able to understand the book's message. go!!ref!1,1,0
nice product.. I ordered the 16 oz. feeder as our old feeder was several years old and falling apart. The new feeder was a disappointment because it was not properly balanced and tilted/spilled when hung by the provided hook. I don't recommend it to anyone. I did not send it back because the shipping charges would make it even more of a bad buy. I'm sticking with Perky Pet products from now on.!ref!0,1,1
