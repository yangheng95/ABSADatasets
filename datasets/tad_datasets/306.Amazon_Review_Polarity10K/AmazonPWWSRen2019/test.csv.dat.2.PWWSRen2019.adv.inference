didn't concluding long. This itme is one of those tools I don't use often, but when I need it there is nothing like a good spindle sander to get around those curves. When I recieved it I was impressed with the way it was built, the nice storage for the extra spindles and the way it worked. I had no need for it really at the moment and after a couple test runs it sat in the corner. Last month I did need it and the nasty grinding sound coming from it did not bode well. The spindle would spin around but there was no oscillation at all. I cleaned everything up as best I could and it gave me a few half hearted movements and more grinding sounds. It is now sitting in the garage and I reclaimed my old spindle sander from my uncle. I was pleased to find out the sleaves fit my old one. I will use them.!ref!0,1,1

"Terrifying--needed a little smoothing.". I am a big fan of the films; Silence of the Lambs and, Hannibal. This is the low book by Thomas Harris I have read. The main reason I had to read this book was the fact that it will soon be a movie.I have my fingers frustrate that this movie does credit to the book. I'm sad to see that the original director did not direct this movie. Since he didn't, a better choice may have been David Fincher (Fight Club). At any rate, I have my hopes up.I was disappointed with the way the author left some parts of the story unfinished, such as the chapter about Dolarhydes childhood. Harris had an excellent chance of putting together a fantastic finale, yet he rushed the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending, as well as the whole book was spooky.

good vendor coverage. I had no idea a book on firewalls could be this bad! The authors have striven to write a definitive Handbook (in the German sense of the word). It spans every major implementation, circa 2003 - Cisco, Nokia, Solairs, linux,... Which explains a substantial part of the heft. The firewall market has these major platforms, and there is enough detail on each for you to be able to install and run it.But the book is more than a set of disparate sections on each vendor. More broadly, it goes into the theory of Intrusion Detection Systems and the common ideas behind most firewalls. You should note that the IDS topic alone is considered sufficiently important by others to have books devoted to it. The level of detail in this book about IDS is not the most comprehensive. But you'll get the gist.So within the covers of this book, you are getting a broad scope of product information and theory. Even if the book's title is somewhat strident.!ref!1,1,0

a terrifying buy on some of the safe music ever written. I can't say enough good things about this compilation of the complete works of J Bach. Just a set of the complete organ music of Bach or the complete cantatas often costs more than this entire 155 CD set of all Bach's music. All of it! Most of the performances are at least good, many are excellent, and some are even superlative. And the sound is excellent throughout.I have admired the Fagius performances of the organ music even before buying this set, having already heard some of his recordings. These alone, incorporated in 17 packed CDs, are worth the price of the set. All 200+ sacred catatas are spread over 60 disks. For me, this has been the highlight because the performers seem to be having such a good time doing the music. It's fun to just pick a number, find it, and enjoy the music.Brilliant Classics has treated us to a real musical banquet. Enjoy the feast!!ref!1,1,0

Shop around, get best price and buy either nonpareil.But...it does not circulate air so don't expect it to really dry out a closet or a cabinet.Works as well as a box of silica gel because that's exactly what it is. But.. no need for long oven bakeouts just plug it in and don't touch for 8 hours. I'll be amazed if a cheap heater like this lasts more than a few regens and I'll just break it open and use the silica gel in a perforated aluminum can which you can regen in an oven. Or use pyrex and Maybe regen slowly at low power in a microwave - haven't tried that and don't recommend it without checking with manufacturers of silica gel.!ref!1,1,0

However in exposing the Nortel possible stock manipulation, the authors' explanation seems plausible.After doing some homework, his recommendation would have returned prices increasing over 8% annually, plus the rates are still higher than bank returns, 4.6% annually.

A easy, miserably stress movie which neediness to be something more than it really is. It did not connive me at all, and I sense it that it was something Stanley Kubrick had guessing if he were smoking hashish in astonishing quantities. The unexampled York fix were artificially unlikely, Tom Cruise's performance was adequately lukewarm-like most of his prioir performances, in this viewer's opinion. The story was at best, uninteresting, and, as you can surmise, I felt that this was an instantly forgettable film unworthy of even a second viewing because I found it to be inordinately boring.

Easier to follow than the cast album. I wish this musical very much! I remember watching the Tony Awards the year that the original production won the Award for Best Musical over "Beauty and the Beast"--the more likely contender for the top prize; and I thought it was a mistake until I had seen the original cast program. I had only heard the cast album of "Beauty" and once I saw "Passion" I saw "Beauty" as an overblown, juvenile production for the kiddies and I don't see how it could have been nominated. I think that Jere Shea is very good-looking gentleman with a good voice as Georgio, Marin Mazzie is a beauty of an actress as Clara and then there is Donna Murphy in her Tony Award-winning performance as Fosca, the unattractive yet passionate older woman reaching out desperately for Georgio's love.

But the more I have had people praise it and then try to tell me why it is so great the more I understand that they are confused. The story of someone who takes everything that someone else has to offer without any thanks or anything to give back is NOT an example of love. It is an example of a truly warped relationship. Anybody out there who thinks that they are really in a relationship when the only thing happening is them giving to the other person(s) needs to build a little self esteem.

I know these knives were not designed to last a lifetime, but I would have paid a few cents more to have them shipped in cardboard blade protectors.(Original): I purchased these primarily because of the great reviews in 'Chef's Illustrated'.

However, I can assure the reader that these do not come close to having the 'heft' of Wusthof Classic,or Henckels Four Star. Having said that, it is ridiculous, based on the price, to try to compare them.'Cooks Illustrated' gave a very nice review of these knives and there is no reason for me to debate that review.

Runs, But Needs Work. As a former naval aviator I can appreciate Vistica's perspective of how the navy mishandled numerous situations. However, the books relies mainly on speculation, and would not "give up in court". Public relations play a large role in politics and the military. Perhaps the navy should look into Clinton's spin machine; he seems to recover intact from seemingly inarguable situations. Ego and competition play a part in every organization, but when it occurs in the military, the results are often front page news. But 99% of the military is made up of outstanding, honest, hardworking individuals, paid with pride and a sense of honor (last sentence written to the Bloomington, IN critic.

Harris's better. This playscript has the respectable discovery scene I've ever read--that moment when the detective notices an overlooked similarity between two crime scenes and understands its significance. The scene is muted, rapt, and rattling."Red Dragon" also has the safe development of an abnormal character I've read. The killer comes from a plausibly rotten family, and his pathology grows by accretion. He aquires an obsession with teeth when he serves in the military; later he happens upon a drawing by William Blake and is galvanized. He puts the teeth and the drawing together, absorbs some Blakeian mysticism, and comes up with his killer persona. Like most readers of the genre, I dislike the flashbacks and the earnest psychologizing that slow a book down. But in "Red Dragon" the flashbacks are far from routine, and the psychologizing is full of incident. Harris knows better than all but a few other writers how to create a madman.!ref!1,1,0
As it says in the title, it is a "personal account".. Krakauer's book is by all means trance. Far from being a literary masterpiece (his writing skills surely do not deserve a Nobel prize), it manages to trigger the fear associated with high-altitude climbing.

I will read Anatoli Boukreev's book next, in order to gain more insight into the tragedy that captivated so many. In hope of not sounding too redundant, it would be senseless to view this book as a finger-pointing rampage. Krakauer actually praises Boukreev's [valiant] efforts during the crisis. As for us, the readers, please keep in mind that we have no place for judging ANYONE, anyhow.!ref!1,1,0

a foliate Turner!. This fresh was a definite page-turner for me! The play started on page one and observe menstruate through until the destruction. Each single of the Matthews sons defend a different walkway of sprightliness: the strong-armer, the minister, and the fellowship humankind. Each has honorable intent but they all induce perpetrate into trine very unmanageable home situations....ironically, it's the fraternal persuasiveness and love (along with a thin-skinned matriarch) that carries forth and pulls them through some very difficult times.I liked Johnson's style of allowing each character to narrate their story. The pace was just right and scenarios were believable; although it made me wince every time I read some words repeatedly used incorrectly outside of the character's dialogue (ex. fambly for family, axed for asked, etc.). Otherwise, it was a great novel.!ref!1,1,0
Very DIssapointed. I purchased this food processor to do smaller jobs. I have used it twice. The first time to simply grate cheese. Simple task, it almost burned the motor out. The second time I was make a dip. The chopping blade is now stuck in the processing bowl. I have the larger 11 cup processor and am very satisified. Much easier to use and even though it costs more, it has been money well spent. I am in the process of sending this back to cuisinart (not to be replaced).!ref!0,1,1

swage Mom. This is bang-up product, however, in order to download spelling words you must order a subscription for $30/year. How hard would it be for them to include the software? I was disappointed because I want to use this for many years and think it's a bit ridiculous. I just wanted to warn everyone because this fact was not advertised on the Leap Frog website or any where else when I was researching this. I feel a bit ripped off!:)!ref!0,1,1

This recording is a bity dry...poor channel. unity don't ensure why anyone would subside for this register. Not only is the phone quality risky(it's stereo but sounds like mono), the interpretation is also dry. Not fifty-fifty the advance was done right. The singers are goodness, though I don't feel other's exuberance for the Figaro here. You may lack to try the show on Decca.!ref!0,1,1

Fits and Tastes flop. Let me start off by saying I hate the taste of municipal water. The chlorine and other tastes make in virtually undrinkable. That's where this filter comes in.For me, the bad news is that I can't stand forking voer $40 to Sears for the privelige of screwing one of these into the filter port of my refrigerator. In my area, these filters are for some reason difficult to find in Big Box stores. I am not sure why. I have taken a chance before on no-name, unbranded filters from the internet and had good results. However, when I saw these OEM filters at a competitive price, I jumped and have not been disappointed. The water that is filtered through them tastes good (no chlorine or mineral tastes) and there are no leaks--they do precisely what inline water filters are supposed to do.Buy the filters, be happy, and drink lots of water.!ref!1,1,0
Too hard, too easy...You've got to be kidding me!. My family LOVES this game. We happened to pick it up late one night and thought it might be a good way to break the ice with new inlaws over for the holidays. Before this game, you could feel the akwardness in the air...but after we played one night we got a long just fine. We all started out quiet, but once we started to get more competitive we wer yelling answers at the top of our lungs! Sure some questions were relly hard, and some were really easy...but it's just the same as Trivial Pursuit. If you're not savvy in a certain subject, of course it's going to be hard. THAT'S THE POINT!!ref!1,1,0

tremendous book to be included in the otherwise great series. This it not Terry Goodkind's best work, to put it kindly. I know there is a reason for him setting up the background on the characters, but it could have been done in a chapter. It's tremendous. For those that thought Soul of the Fire was awful, it was about 10 steps above this one.!ref!0,1,1
a slap-up book. 1 fuck this book!!! I think that it is a great book. Everyone should read it, even those who don't like horses very much. This was a very good book. It was well written and I enjoyed reading it. I think Marguerite Henry is a wonderful author. I would reccomend this book to those who love to read.!ref!1,1,0
No originals, just 'Trane. The irony of the Prestige John Coltrane albums (about 19 in all; I owned them all when they first came out) is that there are no originals. I am told (I think by Ira Gitler) the reason is that Prestige owned all the publishing; so, he saved the originals (he certainly had them in volume) for his later Atlantic recordings. In any case, the music was improbable; don't overlook the ones released under Red Garland's name. We are lucky that this music was recorded and saved in such a short time allowing consistency. It's still timeless.!ref!1,1,0
A bit zany. a morsel wacky, and certainly not exhaustive enough to break anyone any elaborate insight into the world of witchcraft. I am trusted that there are those who believe they have achieved magical things with the spells herein, but my depression is that saying meaningless words and lottery pretty, but again meaningless, simplistic lottery, is not what those who practice wicca, witchcraft, or magick, in any severe way would regard as a dangerous incursion into a fascinating arena of belief.!ref!0,1,1
thrifty! utilization oil to protect your scramble!. The initiative few multiplication I used this trimmer, all was fountainhead. My fuzz (I had a lot) disappeared painlessly and I couldn't be happier.However, I soon developed bumps all over my cheeks, and they rapidly turned into painful red spots. I tried to remove these spots with lotions and cleansers and, after becoming even more irritated, my skin developed dark scars.Now I have bumps under the scars and my skin on my lower cheeks near my jawline is just a mess.I've since stopped using the trimmer, and I'm taking care of my skin over there. It's getting better, but slowly, because I have dark skin and the dark marks stay for longer.ADVICE: Use an oil like tea tree oil (great for pimples, too!) to protect your skin as you trim hair. Never use on dry skin, because you could irritate it. Don't be left with horrible scarring like me.!ref!0,1,1
