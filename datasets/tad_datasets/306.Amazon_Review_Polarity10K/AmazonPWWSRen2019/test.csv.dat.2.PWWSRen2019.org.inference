Bulky! not what i hoped for. after shopping around for wirless headphones for my mp3 player i went with the creative digital wireless headphones, i have a creative labs zen touch mp3 player. the headphones themselves are bulky and fit really funny, they do not stay on your head unless you are sitting very still. the audio sounds great, great bass, but if you are 10 feet or more away from your source yo get a static noise that sounds like a loose cable. for the prce these are ok for indoor use. i returned mine the nxt day i got them, very unhappy with them.!ref!0,0,-100

didn't last long. This itme is one of those tools I don't use often, but when I need it there is nothing like a good spindle sander to get around those curves. When I recieved it I was impressed with the way it was built, the nice storage for the extra spindles and the way it worked. I had no need for it really at the moment and after a couple test runs it sat in the corner. Last month I did need it and the nasty grinding sound coming from it did not bode well. The spindle would spin around but there was no oscillation at all. I cleaned everything up as best I could and it gave me a few half hearted movements and more grinding sounds. It is now sitting in the garage and I reclaimed my old spindle sander from my uncle. I was pleased to find out the sleaves fit my old one. I will use them.!ref!0,0,-100

"Terrifying--needed a little smoothing.". I am a big fan of the films; Silence of the Lambs and, Hannibal. This is the first book by Thomas Harris I have read. The main reason I had to read this book was the fact that it will soon be a movie.I have my fingers crossed that this movie does credit to the book. I'm sad to see that the original director did not direct this movie. Since he didn't, a better choice may have been David Fincher (Fight Club). At any rate, I have my hopes up.I was disappointed with the way the author left some parts of the story unfinished, such as the chapter about Dolarhydes childhood. Harris had an excellent chance of putting together a fantastic finale, yet he rushed the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending, as well as the whole book was spooky. Just a little touch-up and this book would have been a perfect 5.!ref!1,0,-100

No Replacement Bulbs. Light Blaster(tm) Ultra Spectrum Torchiere Floor Lamp is a good lamp, solidly made, but there is a problem with the bulbs.

The bulb which they are now shipping with the lamp, the MaxLite GU24, doesn't fit 2 of the 4 sockets. It is just a little too wide.

good vendor coverage. I had no idea a book on firewalls could be this big! The authors have striven to write a definitive Handbook (in the German sense of the word). It spans every major implementation, circa 2003 - Cisco, Nokia, Solairs, linux,... Which explains a substantial part of the heft. The firewall market has these major platforms, and there is enough detail on each for you to be able to install and run it.But the book is more than a set of disparate sections on each vendor. More broadly, it goes into the theory of Intrusion Detection Systems and the common ideas behind most firewalls. You should note that the IDS topic alone is considered sufficiently important by others to have books devoted to it. The level of detail in this book about IDS is not the most comprehensive. But you'll get the gist.So within the covers of this book, you are getting a broad scope of product information and theory. Even if the book's title is somewhat strident.!ref!1,0,-100

A terrific buy on some of the best music ever written. I can't say enough good things about this compilation of the complete works of JS Bach. Just a set of the complete organ music of Bach or the complete cantatas often costs more than this entire 155 CD set of all Bach's music. All of it! Most of the performances are at least good, many are excellent, and some are even superlative. And the sound is excellent throughout.I have admired the Fagius performances of the organ music even before buying this set, having already heard some of his recordings. These alone, incorporated in 17 packed CDs, are worth the price of the set. All 200+ sacred catatas are spread over 60 disks. For me, this has been the highlight because the performers seem to be having such a good time doing the music. It's fun to just pick a number, find it, and enjoy the music.Brilliant Classics has treated us to a real musical banquet. Enjoy the feast!!ref!1,0,-100

Same as Stack-On SPAD-100. Odentical to Stack-On SPAD-100. So, it's silica gel in a box with it's own regen. heater that plugs in.Convenient to regen but you need 2 to protect your stored items while no. 1 is regenerating for 8+ hours. Shop around, get best price and buy either one.But...it does not circulate air so don't expect it to really dry out a closet or a cabinet.Works as well as a box of silica gel because that's exactly what it is. But.. no need for long oven bakeouts just plug it in and don't touch for 8 hours. I'll be amazed if a cheap heater like this lasts more than a few regens and I'll just break it open and use the silica gel in a perforated aluminum can which you can regen in an oven. Or use pyrex and Maybe regen slowly at low power in a microwave - haven't tried that and don't recommend it without checking with manufacturers of silica gel.!ref!1,0,-100

Makes Sense To Average Person--Nortel exposed. I was hesitant to read the book after reading the "Incoherent" review left by a reviewer. I read the other book by this author and actually won a few good bets, one of the recent bets I won is shown as an image on the other book page. Seems the reviewer who wrote "Incoherent" must have a beef with the author.I can see that there are areas of the book that can be hard to understand if someone is looking for a quick simple explanation of investing techniques or tips to get rich now. However in exposing the Nortel possible stock manipulation, the authors' explanation seems plausible.After doing some homework, his recommendation would have returned prices increasing over 8% annually, plus the rates are still higher than bank returns, 4.6% annually.

This camera is horrible and customer service stinks. I purchased two of these cameras for wildlife surveys and they both worked for about 1 week then one of them started to only take black images both day and night. So I sent it in for repair and they charged me 10$ to send it in even though it was under warranty then I got it back and it worked for a few weeks and it messed up again and I sent it in again and another 10$ and then it broke again so I gave up on this camera. The other system worked for about 1 month got some good images on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust. Probably should just throw them away.

A "dreamy" movie that puts you to sleep. The film struck me as though I were watching it after having had as much champagne as Nicole Kidman had at the party at the outset. A slow, miserably trying movie which wants to be something more than it actually is. It did not intrigue me at all, and I felt it that it was something Stanley Kubrick had shot if he were smoking hashish in astonishing quantities. The New York locations were artificially unconvincing, Tom Cruise's performance was adequately lukewarm-like most of his prioir performances, in this viewer's opinion. The story was at best, uninteresting, and, as you can surmise, I felt that this was an instantly forgettable film unworthy of even a second viewing because I found it to be inordinately boring. The only highlight for me was seeing Nicole Kidman's tantalizingly luscious nipples.!ref!0,0,-100

Easier to follow than the cast album. I liked this musical very much! I remember watching the Tony Awards the year that the original production won the Award for Best Musical over "Beauty and the Beast"--the more likely contender for the top prize; and I thought it was a mistake until I had seen the original cast program. I had only heard the cast album of "Beauty" and once I saw "Passion" I saw "Beauty" as an overblown, juvenile production for the kiddies and I don't see how it could have been nominated. I think that Jere Shea is very good-looking gentleman with a good voice as Georgio, Marin Mazzie is a beauty of an actress as Clara and then there is Donna Murphy in her Tony Award-winning performance as Fosca, the unattractive yet passionate older woman reaching out desperately for Georgio's love.

great way to promote our self absorbed culture. This book and the praise it has generated over the years has always bothered me. At first I thought it meant I was just too selfish. But the more I have had people praise it and then try to tell me why it is so great the more I understand that they are confused. The story of someone who takes everything that someone else has to offer without any thanks or anything to give back is NOT an example of love. It is an example of a truly warped relationship. Anybody out there who thinks that they are really in a relationship when the only thing happening is them giving to the other person(s) needs to build a little self esteem.

Pure Country Classics: The #1 Hits. While I could not be dubbed an overt Country music fan, I was motivated to purchase this CD because it contained many hits with which I was familiar when growing up in the 50's and 60's. A good number of these tunes were "crossover" hits, appearing simultaneously on both Country and Pop music charts. The tunes are all very melodic and evocative of their era and "classics" all. I highly recommend this to music lovers of all stripes, particularly to those who grew up when the lines between rock n' roll and country music were blurred.!ref!1,0,-100
Bad. I had to read this book for school, and, first let me say I'm not just some highs chooler who hates to read, my favorite writers are Kafka, Faulkner and Dostoevsky, but this book was all but utter trash.

Toddy cold brew coffee maker. After calling around to different local coffee shops, I purchased a Toddy T2N Cold Brew System from Amazon. It was exactly as described and it arrived a day earlier than I expected. Amazon gave "free" shipping for this item - making it very convenient.I recommend "cold brew coffee"! It is brewed once and can be kept in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. You add the brewed coffee with water to make each cup. The taste is smooth and the cold brew system cuts out some of the acid in the coffee.!ref!1,0,-100

Toss this in the garbage - there are better Dyer books. Or, you may prefer to tear out the pages that are not worthwhile; Dyer has truly written some excellent books. However, the ones you want to read are those he published in the 80's and 90's. There's a lot of sage wisdom to be found in those. But this? Please. I've written this old man off mainly because he's discarded common sense for religious nonsense, and that's really disappointing. May I share one of the bits of "insight" to be found in this book? Here: "LIVE the Ten Commandments". Say WHAT?!? Once I read that, I nearly cracked up laughing. What delusion.

Imagine Da Vinci's Giocconda with the surrounding landscape cut off.. As Barry Stone coments (I do totally agree and fairly recomend to read his review before buying the item (sorrowfully I didn't)) I have waited too long to see this beautiful Piece of Art on DVD. "Tis Pity the most beautiful scenes have been cut off". Two of them could have been maybe eliminated for its nudity or sexual content: an incredibly filmed horse intercourse, and the dead brother execution procession. But also, the most surprising beginning is out: before Film credits and name appear, there is a long landscape scene within a colorless winter dry tree forest you swear the film will be a black and white one, when suddenly the camera falls over the only orange leave lasting in this gray branches web. That is art, I will never forget. That film is quite old and has become yellowish and faded is understandable in some way. Unfortunately,"tis also a pity".

Brilliant - Audio version was captivating. This review is based on the audio version. First let me say, that I generally do not care for short stories, and I have also managed to avoid most books about war. Once I began listening to this book, I would find myself sitting in my car (after having reached my destination) just to hear a bit more. The reader was fabulous and the stories ...all of them....just had me wanting to hear more.The Things They Carried is a collection of short stories filled with tension. The stories are based on the Vietnam War experience of the author and his buddies. The reader/listener is drawn into each story involving the men of Alpha Company. You feel a part of the bond they have for each other, and you feel their anger, their isolation, loneliness and their fears as you listen to the voices of the soldiers.This should be required reading for high school students in my opinion.!ref!1,0,-100

Very light and very sharp!. (9/11 Update): I find myself using the 'bird beak' parer almost daily. It is beginning to dull a bit. I know these knives were not designed to last a lifetime, but I would have paid a few cents more to have them shipped in cardboard blade protectors.(Original): I purchased these primarily because of the great reviews in 'Chef's Illustrated'. These are exceptionally sharp (and thin). I do not have a clue as to how long the sharp blades will last. However, I can assure the reader that these do not come close to having the 'heft' of Wusthof Classic,or Henckels Four Star. Having said that, it is ridiculous, based on the price, to try to compare them.'Cooks Illustrated' gave a very nice review of these knives and there is no reason for me to debate that review.

Not quite up to OXO standards. I wanted to wait to give this some usage before reviewing. Now that we have used it for six months, we have ordered a replacement.

To Be Continued...?. Shades of Rick Berman, I paid for a whole book, not a part 1 that leaves me hanging like the first installment of a 2-part Star Trek episode. Regarding the content, I found the story line incongruous with the TV series regarding the attitude of Starfleet to the Voyager crew. I found it difficult to believe the events of book were plausible.I was not a great far of Voyager when it was airing but have rediscovered it on Netflix and now can't get enough of it. I was hoping for a satisfying epilogue to the series finale, "Endgame", which I found to be one of the best episodes contained in any of the ST series franchises. My only complaint was the rather abrupt ending that I had hoped this book would resolve. So far, not so. I will buy part 2 to see what happens to the crew. Hopefully there will be some resolution of the characters lives.!ref!0,0,-100
Good movie but read the book FIRST. Not a bad adaptation of a book, but, as with many flicks, reading the book first will help the movie make sense. The book's creepier and richer, but some of the movie's musical numbers are amusing and creative in their own way.The Wybie character might have been introduced to meet the PC/diversity compulsion of modern cinema. Wybie is a distraction, then an irritant, and finally his role destroys a major part of Coraline's character development present in the book.So I'd say, buy and read the book first, then view the movie.!ref!1,0,-100

The hand-to-hand combat scenes are completely remarkable, and the character of Dethen manages to be an extremely likable villain. This is quite possibly the best book I've ever read.!ref!1,0,-100
It works! for almost two months?. I used this in a sick house bedroom (lots of mold about including one toxic strain, likely due to a leaking ceiling) and I was no longer sneezing before going to bed each night. In a month's time, however, the unit was already constantly making random noises that sounded like its bulb was about to explode, and the light would flicker on and off, often waking me up, all night long. I got another air filter machine, (True Allergen Remover: HEPA type?) and that seems to help maybe as good as this machine, but as the bulb to this unit burnt out in just over two months of use, I'll be sticking with my other machine. Even if I got a new bulb for this, I don't want to be constantly woken up by this thing. If I hadn't been in the process of moving and packing stuff up I would have tried calling the company to get a replacement bulb.Be Warned!!ref!0,0,-100
Great Exercise!. I purchased three Denise Austin workout DVD's at one time. Why? Denise Austin is in her 50's, has always stayed fit, and is such an encourager to be healthy and exercise for your life! This DVD is great, harder than I thought it would be, but a great workout. I would also suggest reading Denise's book "Fit and Fabulous After 40"; it is an awesome book full of great information, and certainly applicable to aging and weight loss. Denise is the same throughout all her videos, she gently pushes to keep you going so you have the most benefit.!ref!1,0,-100
Expensive, but works perfectly. While I can't compare this product's effectiveness to that of other screen cleaners, as this is the first one I've ever used, this product works amazingly well and restored my LCD to its original glory.I bought this based on the other reviews, specifically mentioning the Powerbook, because my MacBook Pro screen was extremely dirty, with streaks on it that clearly annoyed during movie playback. It arrived, and voila, my MacBook Pro's screen looks factory new.The solution lets out a bit of a foamy soap when rubbed in, and it just works wonders. The only thing is, this product is quite expensive. Not surprising considering it's a "Monster" product.!ref!1,0,-100
Myst sequel didn't quite live up to expectations. I have loved, played, and collected the Myst games for years, but Myst Revelation was slightly disappointing. I didn't get as absorbed into the story line as much. The game is still fun, and just as challenging, with beautiful graphics, I just enjoyed the previous ones better. If you are planning on buying it, please do!! Just don't expect as much as the first 3 previous Myst games.!ref!1,0,-100
Worked great, then it didn't. I've had this speaker dock mostly in my office for the last 3 months and used it mostly every work day. When it worked, it worked great but then it just stopped working.

Started out great..... I really enjoyed my Moto Rokr s9's for the first week. Then the touch buttons to turn the sound up and down stopped working. Then the move 1 song back button stopped working. Then today the volume, which I can't control via the buttons on its own went down while I was wearing them without me doing anything. And I can't get the volume back up because the buttons stopped working. Fortunately Amazon is sending me a replacement, but I am expecting better quality out of these. If not I will lower my rating to zero stars.!ref!0,0,-100
leak ALL the time. These cups definitely leak no matter how you close them. I have called avent several times about this and they claim that the cups and the rest of the spout assembly need to be boiled at least once a month with a couple of spoons of vinegar to remove any minerals or residue. I tried this and they still leak. I don't know if all sippy cups leak to some extent, but these cups really leave a mess everywhere and I don't want anyone else wasting their money on them. I loved the Avent bottles, but these cups are just horrible.!ref!0,0,-100
Runs, But Needs Work. As a former naval aviator I can appreciate Vistica's perspective of how the navy mishandled numerous situations. However, the books relies mainly on speculation, and would not "hold up in court". Public relations play a large role in politics and the military. Perhaps the navy should look into Clinton's spin machine; he seems to recover intact from seemingly inarguable situations. Ego and competition play a part in every organization, but when it occurs in the military, the results are often front page news. But 99% of the military is made up of outstanding, honest, hardworking individuals, paid with pride and a sense of honor (last sentence written to the Bloomington, IN critic. Yes, I'm glad you went the MBA route also. The military needs strong leaders, not weak followers).!ref!0,0,-100
Buyer Beware. I have had Epson printers for over 10 years so I know a good Epson printer when I see one. This is not a good printer. The colours are dull despite being heavy on ink and the printer needs constant head cleaning to keep away heavy banding. While not being a professional standard at this price you would expect this to be a quality product. Mine failed after 15 months and, in my opinion, Tech Support are neither Technical or Supportive.I would strongly advise caution before paying your hard earned cash for this unit. As for me I moved to a Canon i9100 - Lets see if this fares any better.!ref!0,0,-100
(Bad). Well first let me say that he got one star because he had enough courage to put out some trash like that. The album is beyond terrible. I should have known that it would be hot garbage from seing him perform. He lip sincs and he has no stage presence. He IS ADORABLE but that is about it. He yells through the whole album and the songs are corny. He needs to take some lesson from LBW on how to rap cuz his daddy can't rap either. Also the little boy has hair extensions. But I recommend that you all go buy LBW'S new CD Doggy Bag. It has hot tracks produced by JD and the neptunes and the raps are tyte.!ref!0,0,-100
Junk. This book is basically a word for word copy from freely avaliable online documents and other books. The author fails to mention the documents that he uses as sources for his factual information. The worst part is, some of the sources the author used were unreliable themselves. Talking about libnet like it is a program just shows how inexperienced the author is in the subject he is writing about. How could one possibly write a technical book about something they don't know much about. As for the ethical part, there is hardly anything ethical about breaking into other systems. If you want to know how the hackers really get in, get hacking exposed. Hacking Exposed pulls no punches on describing how it is actually done. Spend your money on better things.!ref!0,0,-100
Not the typical Sony product. As a believer in Sony products, I was shocked at the low quality of this item. A few issues were:- Range: Was reported to be 24 feet. Best I got was 10 feet.- Noise: Constantly heard loud hiss.- Battery: Was never able to get it to fully charged.- Overall quality: Would only work for 5 minutes at a time.I returned this product to Amazon and urge you to consider a different wireless headphone.!ref!0,0,-100

Excellent choice!. This camera was actually purchased for my teenage daughter. This is our 4th Easyshare Camera and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I purchased a different Easyshare in March and, although it is wonderful, once I saw how small and easy to use this one is - I wish I would have waited and got this same one instead. I find myself borrowing this one from my daughter and using it more than my own (which is also a wonderful camera)...!ref!1,0,-100
Harris's best. This book has the best discovery scene I've ever read--that moment when the detective notices an overlooked similarity between two crime scenes and understands its significance. The scene is hushed, rapt, and real."Red Dragon" also has the best development of an abnormal character I've read. The killer comes from a plausibly rotten family, and his pathology grows by accretion. He aquires an obsession with teeth when he serves in the military; later he happens upon a drawing by William Blake and is galvanized. He puts the teeth and the drawing together, absorbs some Blakeian mysticism, and comes up with his killer persona. Like most readers of the genre, I dislike the flashbacks and the earnest psychologizing that slow a book down. But in "Red Dragon" the flashbacks are far from routine, and the psychologizing is full of incident. Harris knows better than all but a few other writers how to create a madman.!ref!1,0,-100
As it says in the title, it is a "personal account".. Krakauer's book is by all means fascinating. Far from being a literary masterpiece (his writing skills surely do not deserve a Nobel prize), it manages to trigger the fear associated with high-altitude climbing. Rather than comparing the characters' heroics (or lack thereof), the reader should focus on the description of effort and hardship of all of the expeditioneers who were present during those fateful days of May '96. I will read Anatoli Boukreev's book next, in order to gain more insight into the tragedy that captivated so many. In hope of not sounding too redundant, it would be senseless to view this book as a finger-pointing rampage. Krakauer actually praises Boukreev's [valiant] efforts during the crisis. As for us, the readers, please keep in mind that we have no place for judging ANYONE, anyhow.!ref!1,0,-100

AWSOME GAME. This was my first game for the PSP. I was amazed by the graphics on this game there great! The tracks are great and very fun. Though there aren't many tracks they still remain very fun anytime you play them. The speed classes you can play are insane. You start off pretty slow but every speed class is much faster than the last witch provides a good challege anytime. The cars or pods or ships or whatever you wanna call the things you race are amazing. It takes different skills to race each 1 so being good with 1 doesn't mean your a master of the game. One of my favorite parts of this game is the downloads. You can go online with this game and download new stuff like new tracks, racers, and wallpapers. Overall this game is 1 of the best games for the PSP. This is a must buy!ref!1,0,-100

Pleased with bottle warmer. My husband and I have found this bottle warmer to be very effective and work great for our needs. We use the Avent bottles and have had great success with this product for heating them up. It heats them evenly, unlike the microwave. We noticed that it's important to read the instructions thoroughly before using it. It's also important to keep the heating chamber cleaned out and free of water deposits. This caused ours to under-heat the bottles. It took a little getting used to in order to understand how much water to use for what size bottle we're trying to heat, but over all we like it and we've gotten a lot of use out of our bottle warmer.!ref!1,0,-100

A Page Turner!. This novel was a definite page-turner for me! The drama started on page one and kept flowing through until the end. Each one of the Matthews sons represents a different walk of life: the thug, the minister, and the family man. Each has good intentions but they all get pulled into three very difficult family situations....ironically, it's the brotherly strength and love (along with a feisty matriarch) that carries forth and pulls them through some very difficult times.I liked Johnson's style of allowing each character to narrate their story. The pace was just right and scenarios were believable; although it made me wince every time I read some words repeatedly used incorrectly outside of the character's dialogue (ex. fambly for family, axed for asked, etc.). Otherwise, it was a great novel.!ref!1,0,-100
Very DIssapointed. I purchased this food processor to do smaller jobs. I have used it twice. The first time to simply grate cheese. Simple task, it almost burned the motor out.

Fits and Tastes Right. Let me start off by saying I hate the taste of municipal water. The chlorine and other tastes make in virtually undrinkable. That's where this filter comes in.For me, the bad news is that I can't stand forking voer $40 to Sears for the privelige of screwing one of these into the filter port of my refrigerator. In my area, these filters are for some reason difficult to find in Big Box stores. I am not sure why. I have taken a chance before on no-name, unbranded filters from the internet and had good results. However, when I saw these OEM filters at a competitive price, I jumped and have not been disappointed. The water that is filtered through them tastes good (no chlorine or mineral tastes) and there are no leaks--they do precisely what inline water filters are supposed to do.Buy the filters, be happy, and drink lots of water.!ref!1,0,-100

Too hard, too easy...You've got to be kidding me!. My family LOVES this game.

We all started out quiet, but once we started to get more competitive we wer yelling answers at the top of our lungs!

No originals, just 'Trane. The irony of the Prestige John Coltrane albums (about 19 in all; I owned them all when they first came out) is that there are no originals. I am told (I think by Ira Gitler) the reason is that Prestige owned all the publishing; so, he saved the originals (he certainly had them in volume) for his later Atlantic recordings. In any case, the music was marvelous; don't overlook the ones released under Red Garland's name. We are lucky that this music was recorded and saved in such a short time allowing consistency. It's still timeless.!ref!1,0,-100
It's Great!!!. Tamora Pierce has outdone herself once again. I have read most of her books and believe that this is the best yet.

We are also finally given a chance to be reintroduced to characters from other books who haven't been able to take a role in Kel's study's yet.

Careful! Use oil to protect your skin!. The first few times I used this trimmer, all was well. My fuzz (I had a lot) disappeared painlessly and I couldn't be happier.However, I soon developed bumps all over my cheeks, and they rapidly turned into painful red spots. I tried to remove these spots with lotions and cleansers and, after becoming even more irritated, my skin developed dark scars.Now I have bumps under the scars and my skin on my lower cheeks near my jawline is just a mess.I've since stopped using the trimmer, and I'm taking care of my skin over there. It's getting better, but slowly, because I have dark skin and the dark marks stay for longer.ADVICE: Use an oil like tea tree oil (great for pimples, too!) to protect your skin as you trim hair. Never use on dry skin, because you could irritate it. Don't be left with horrible scarring like me.!ref!0,0,-100
