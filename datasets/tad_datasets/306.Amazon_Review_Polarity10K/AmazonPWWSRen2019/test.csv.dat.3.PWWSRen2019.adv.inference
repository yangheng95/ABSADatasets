Read 'A Good Man is Hard to Find' to understand this movie. This movie is a grisly fairy-tale, Little Red Riding Hood with all the gory details of the wolf's attacks and his death by axe. The child is the key to the story. The violence is so exaggerated as to be a horrible parody. The line the male killer makes (who has no name by the way) at the end about the little girl is everything. A very dark comic parable. Don't take its over-the-top violence seriously.!ref!1,1,0
Sorry, but it's on-key. 2 genius. I love the book series, but the movie was disappointing. Now my family thinks the books are boring and that I have a lousy sense of good reading. This was the only thing that I thought could get my husband interested in reading the books, but he slept through most of the movie. I am sorry to all the hard working people.I don't think you should make any movies of the other books . I have read #'S 1-6 and can't wait to get # 7 in soft. Please, if you read this, do not skip the books. THE KIDS books are not as good, but they have different characters and stories. PLEASE USE YOUR MONEY ON THE BOOKS.

discovery a salutary book. This book is comprehensive, yes, but the explanations are piteous. I find his writing style difficult to postdate. The book is poorly edited as well, for example, the second chapter introduces datapath logic cells and then immediately goes into a multipage treatise of multiplier architecture. Interesting information but it seems much out of place given the context. The problems are not very helpful either. Often you will need to search for information outside of the text in order to complete the question. The author obviously knows the subject well, I just don't think he does a very good job of teaching it.!ref!0,1,1

Scandle, sex, and sport. iodine never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this ledger and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of plight you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting life, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.!ref!1,1,0
A masterpiece. Of course he never wrote an autobiography, but if he told it to cronies, it would sound like this, then he'd have them shot. So imagine Stalin telling his life story, a crude thug boasting of his power, telling little anecdotes about exterminating millions, and sharing his innermost "thoughts". It's disgraceful humor at its best. Lourie is a sovietologist and literary translator from Russian, he's done the research, spent time in Russia, he knows his stuff. It's hard to imagine a more accurate portrait of the monster, and once you start reading, you can't put it down. Should be required reading, lest we forget. Highly recommended.!ref!1,1,0

axerophthol poignant narration of a young Irish-American Boy ..

self-colored book on Java networking. The book covers numerous topics. For background material, it covers TCP/IP theory, security, threading, exceptions, and streams. In the actual networking part of the book, it covers client-side and server-side networking, URLs, datagrams, multicasting, RMI, CORBA, Servlets, and Message Streams. In other words, there is a wide range of topics covered.The book is full of actual code examples. I especially enjoyed one like the finger client and the dns client. These are real world examples that will be extremely useful if I ever need to implement these protocols using Java.One error that I noticed was that it mentioned that the source code from the book was available from two web sites. In reality, at the present time, it is only available from the first one mentioned.Overall, it is a book that is worth owning and has the broadest coverage of any of the Java networking books on the market.!ref!1,1,0

It's chewy and flavored but breaks off easily which brings the final point...It lasted all of maybe 30 minutes. At the end of that time period my dog had bleedig gums and tongue (I stopped playing with him immediately) and while my back was turned, grabbed the tug toy off the table to chew which immediately resulted in a big chunk coming off in his mouth that he promptly swallowed. Hopefully he will be okay but now we are left "keeping an eye" for things to "pass".Save a trip to the vet and avoid this awful product!!ref!0,1,1

discomfited. This is not Wolinsky's trump effort.offset, it needs good editing.Second, this is just a re-packaging of the current pop psychology remember. Wolinsky bring to the disarray by supply another constituent. alternatively of YOU play out on unconscious press, Wolinsky inaugurate 'privileged Child' and 'Hypnosis'... so today the privileged shaver HYPNOTIZES you into do out on unconscious advocate.What's his response? The same as the old psycho-analytic approach: awareness. When you can become CONSCIOUSLY aware of the processes and the relationships then *poof* they are resolved!I was disappointed that this "Quantum Psychology" expert put so little thought or effort into this book. If you have any education in the area of psychology, this is a waste of your time.!ref!0,1,1

I love the book but it hurts a little to see what I'm doing to myself.!ref!1,1,0
prissy little whistling kettle. This whistling tea kettle heats enough water to make two 12-oz cups of tea, hot cocoa, etc. The whistle starts as a cute little chirping sound as the water begins to create steam, then progresses to a rather loud, sharp whistling that you just can't ignore. The easy-fill opening is very nice, too. Don't overfill, though, because you'll end up with a hot, wet mess on your stove top.!ref!1,1,0

Customer support is awesome. Vosky worked great for several months. When Skype upgraded their software the Vosky sofware was not compatable. Vosky customer support offered several different solutions, but thus far none have worked.Each time you contact their customer support, you must fill out a new problem report form. I am about ready to throw Vosky in the Methedrine.!ref!0,1,1
Great movie, just couldn't watch it at home. I guess I missed the fine print about the format of this exceptional dvd. I was unable to play it on my home dvd player. So, I emaciate my money. If Amazon is selling dvds with different formats, then putting the particular format in big bold letters would have prevented this sort of thing.!ref!0,1,1
Protracted and Expensive. This is the first of six kits, each equally priced. I regain the method to be fraught with language cues that were too syrupy to swallow ("popping above the line", "solution sandwich", "lifestyle surgery", and "tender morsels"). Doing cycles are at the heart of the platform, a operation that, for me, add itself more to manufacturing emotion quintet. excavating damaging shadow beliefs. I cease up falling out, and feeling much better for it.I'd recommend saving your money on this one. Try Martha Beck's Joy Diet instead.!ref!0,1,1

Expensive lover in a box. The intersection description does not make it clear, but this device is not a digital sound generator. It's just a fan in a box with two power settings (high and very high) and some bevels that you can adjust. The two settings are very similar, and for many people this will mean that the lowest setting will not be quiet enough, or the highest setting will not be loud enough. This is a lot of money to earnings for a fan in a box, and I wish I could get my money back. I recommend the Sharper Image sound generator, instead. It has a volume knob as well as options for selecting different types of background noise.!ref!0,1,1

GOT IT FIRST. I haven't purchased this album, and i probably won't because, as has been said, it's too expensive. however, i know all these songs because i bought all the singles as they came out! If you get them at the right stores, they are much cheaper than this. try newberry comics, or any other local non-franchise store that you can find. 10 songs and 40 bucks?

Hardly a volume to worry a person who thinks for himself.. When we talk about Kirby Godsey, let's be honest. The author has a foresighted way to go to reach someone who has thought beyond the preachments of Southern Baptists and others. I suppose some case could be made for this work to be compared with Tillich's "The Shaking of the Foundations," which didn't shake any foundations to my knowledge, though some found it interesting. Another book from the past comes to mind, "Your God is too small." I guess I just don't feel the need of anyone else telling me what God is really like or what the Bible really means or what should be going on in the churches. The rampant confusion on matters religious is well beyond the ability of Dr. Godsey to say anything of any real importance. Godsey's own denomination is one of the better examples of the confusion of which I speak.!ref!0,1,1
put me to rest!. I tried to determine this picture twice and I couldn't cease it. Everyone else must have seen a different movie than I did. The pacing was easy, I couldn't resist the main quality and I had no idea where it was loss. one felt dark for the brother and thought that the main eccentric was the freehanded pretender in the existence. Don't waste your time with this unmatchable!!ref!0,1,1
decently for removing upper lip/chin tomentum. unity guess I'm fail against the crowd and have to say I ilk this intersection quite a bit. It's not perfect but it help me select off most of the whisker on my upper lip and the voiced hair on my chin.The only defective thing about that is, if you impart the cream on for more than ogdoad minutes, it tends to sting for an hour or deuce after wiping off the cream. sol if the hair comes off around 6 minutes, please happily do so!Tip: BE SURE TO USE WARM MOIST PAPER TOWEL. It'll help with removing the hair. :)!ref!1,1,0
A decent Movie. This is my favorite movie. I have watched it over and over. I never get tired of Frosty the Snowman. I like the actors who do the voices.
