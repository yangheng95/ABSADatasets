Horrid movie. This is a sad knock-off of the classic film Rocky Horror. it is over the top campy, the comedy is predictable and the movie is horrible, I would not wish a viewing of this movie on anyone. save yourself and dont watch it.!ref!0,0,-100
PSYCH. Oh joy! A show that is fast paced, witty, and clean.

Another horrible remake. No insult to the lovely Jessica Alba but after viewing this, she is not ready for any lead roles yet. The movie was basically generic, the acting was sub par and the movie did not have that horror movie feel to it. There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new. The plot was thin and so was the pacing of the entire film. You don't care for any of the characters and trust me; I have been watching and collecting horror movies for years. This one stinks, badly. Hollywood needs to stop butchering Asian films. If you never seen the Ring, put this movie down and watch the Ring instead. Alba could have learned a few pointers from Mrs. Watts.!ref!0,0,-100

LOVE Jackie, Don't love the new Freddy.. I adore Jackie Earle Haley as an actor. He's one of the best, I actually enjoyed the whole cast, but I don't appreciate them trying to recreate Freddy. I understand that they were trying to make him scarier, but that's just not who Freddy is. He's a little scary at times, but he also likes to crack jokes at every opportunity. That's just who Freddy is, it doesn't work any other way. They might as well try to create a whole new villain with Freddy's MO... never mind, I don't want them doing that either. Just, leave Freddy alone. ROBERT FOREVER.!ref!0,0,-100
Gold Toes Bermuda Socks. I love these socks. For a few years, I have bought them at JC Penney's, but this year, they did not have the color I like -- stone. Stone-colored socks go veryGold Toe Women's Bermuda Turn Cuff Sock, size 9-11well with khakis, which I wear a lot. The Gold Toes website also does not show these socks in stone, just black and white, so I figure that stone-colored socks are no longer being made. That's why I bought 2 dozen pair.The socks are very soft, comfortable, and cozy, not too tight or too loose. I will miss them when they are gone. The photo that goes with this review may show the so-called "khaki"-colored sock. The stone sock is lighter in color and goes really well with most khaki or chino pants. The khaki-colored sock is too dark for most khaki or chino pants.!ref!1,0,-100
Cannot stand listening to this performance. Time passes fast, and 1970 is a prehistorical age for this kind of music.I had the bad idea to buy this recording: Britten is directing this music disregarding his own annotations on the scores he adapted !! (I had to study them for a concert).But worst, soloists are singing in a terrible "italian melodrammatic style" (as we say "with big potatoes in their mouth"). The chorus is too large, the tempo too slow, terribly slow. The brasses are untuned, the orchestra is not convincing at all.Dido and Aeneas follows the same destiny.Want to buy back my CDs :)?!ref!0,0,-100

I was not impressed. I realize that this was one of Nora Roberts' earlier books, so the fact that the writing was not as good did not surprise me. However, I was very dissapointed that she speant almost no time letting the readers see Seth's thoughts until the very end and then, in a very uncharacteristic move for Roberts, allows her heroin to forgive him without too much changing or apoligizing on his part. I think this was an interesting book to read because of the fact that it was so early into Roberts' career but as a novel, I was just not impressed.!ref!0,0,-100
tedious to read. This book had some interesting plot twists, and certainly the author is talented and has a very literary (if not pompous) style that results in some beautiful passages.

She feels as though she is being treated like a child- well, its not exactly an adult thing to do to abandon all of your responsibilities.

My new favorite. The novel Slaughter House Five is a great story. It describes Billy Pilgrim's time travel and adventures throughout the whole book. The writer kept me going and I could not put this book down. It is definitely a reread and I look forward to reading more of Kurt Vonnegut's writing pieces. Though, the reason I am giving this a four star, is because of the introduction.

Dependable & stylish. I bought my Tag eight years ago and have worn it for scuba diving, skiing, exercising, and eating at top French restaurants. Every two or three years I change the battery; otherwise it needs no attention and has performed flawlessly. The only annoying things with the watch are (i) the bezel is difficult to grip with wet fingers or dive gloves, and (ii) there is insufficient contrast between the dial face and the hands when you're underwater, which makes it difficult sometimes to read the time. These two limitations are a function of the fact it was designed more to be fashionable than functional - but it does function pretty well regardless.Many people (men and women) have commented over the years on how attractive the watch is. I wanted a watch that would be able to go wherever I went and be appropriate regardless of conditions. I also wanted something that wasn't too fussy. The Tag has served me well and I don't envisage replacing it anytime soon.!ref!1,0,-100

This thing will heat your whole house and everything in it. I bought the 402b because it has HDMI switching, lots of input options, and hightly rated sound output. I also bought it because I have had a JVC audio system for 15 years and love it.The good part of the receiver is it's great specifications and HDMI support. The bad part is that it that the hardware is poorly executed. It is inexcusable to put out a product that becomes too hot to touch after half an hour of use at normal sound volumes. JVC apparently thinks it's some kind of crime to put cooling fans in receivers. As a result, you get a box that is cool to the touch in standby, and so hot that you literally can't touch the top after half an hour of use. I had to drill extra holes in the back of my entertainment center, and am now out looking for a PC fan that I can run along side it.I would be surprised if I don't have a different receiver within the month.If you live in Alaska, go for it. Otherwise, I'd shop around.!ref!0,0,-100

Loved it!. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. Very cute story and a lot of tension between the h/h since this was a 'forbidden' romance plot. If you've ever been a fan of reality tv this is a fun story of what could happen behind the scenes from one of your fav shows. The only downside was continual references to the heroines sister who was flakey and self absorbed. But I enjoyed JM so much that I was willing to read the sequel who happens to star the flakey sister, but based on reviews this book went in the opposite direction from this one with a murder plot. Meh..keep writing more sweet love stories like Jane Millionaire!! Trust me, they dont always need to involve murder mystery, vampires, shape shifters or paransormal plots.

We all live our lives based on our own perceptions of truth.

Always Writes Ahead Of The Curve. Candace Bushnell always writes ahead of the curve. The women of Sex and the City were ahead of their time, and now Bushnell has shown us a new breed of women in Lipstick Jungle. These women are strong, powerful, successful, and flawed. They, like so many women today, are entrepreneurs in the corporate world. But what I especially love about this book is the attention that Bushnell pays to their flaws. Nobody is perfect, and nobody was ever meant to be. These three women face the same difficulties as women everywhere: temptation, finding love, divorce, fear of failure, etc... And even though these women live in a world few of us will ever be part of, each still struggles to figure out what will truly make them happy. Bushnell's characters are human, and women everywhere will be able to relate to them.!ref!1,0,-100

Duped IS the word!!!. Believe it or not, we watched this movie from beginning to end--just to see if there's ANY redeeming feature. What a waste of time! We've enjoyed all sorts of movies, from the serious to the ridiculous--but this movie is totally pointless. Pointless doesn't even begin to describe it. What a cheap piece of #%$&@%! If you have any appreciation for the art of movie-making, for a good story, for good acting, for provocative ideas, for a good laugh, or even for the sheer entertainment value of the ridiculous, don't spend any money on it.

Blood-soaked history at it's best. From a musical, mythological, & historical perspective, this is some of the best viking metal out there. After listening to this album it's hard not to be nostalgic about the era in which the vikings made a name for themselves.Musically, I would compare this band to iced earth...plenty of growls, but the vocalist is also capable of a wide range of melodic screams.I also highly recommend Miklagard, and anything by Doomsword.!ref!1,0,-100

Excellent, but somewhat dated, travel guide.. As long as the reader understands that this book was released in 2004, before Hurricane Katrina, this is still a very useful guide to New Orleans, especially the French Quarter. Some businesses have changed or gone under due to the lack of tourist trade, but the French Quarter had almost no significant damage from the storm. We visited New Orleans in June of 2008, so we took this book with us. There is a revised issue coming in the late Fall of 2008, so if your trip is after that time wait for the new revision. The information is very well presented, and the book is a great carry-around guide.!ref!1,0,-100

Terrible Causes MS Outlook to Crash - Nonresponsive Customer Service. Terrible Product! I installed it and it made my MS Outlook crash several times a day. Twice I had to reinstall Outlook. Contacted their customer service about the problem. No help, they kept telling me how to reset my Zone Alarm account password. Obviously they don't read their incoming emails and just send out some canned message. After several days of this, I uninstalled Zone Alarm and installed PC-cillin. I had no further problems with Outlook. I previously used Norton and never had my email crash with their product either.

Beautiful book - worth persisting with. I picked up this book with great expectiations, having recently devoured Cloud Street, The Riders, Shallows, Scission and an Open Swimmer I was looking forward to more from my favourite writer.After the first couple of chapters I was struggling to like it, wonedring where he was going and why he was painting such poor characters and situations (I really don't like the way some authors potray the internet). It seemed a bit close to Shallows as well for.But then the story griped me. Being a West Aussie myself and having lived in most of the areas this book picked up on I could really identify with the landscapes and people as their characters developed.The story to me was one of how people lived their lives dealing with deaths and how letting go and realising that dead people are not more than they were and shouldn't be built up into images that restrict you living your life.!ref!1,0,-100

Poor quality. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!! Not the quality I am used to. My husband purchased this as a present for me because he knows I love to cook in cast iron. I was skeptical once I seen the product.

I actually had to scrub the pan clean. It was returned!! After some research, I still can't find if the Camp Chef products are made in China. With it not actually being said on Amazon the country of origin. I would assume that it is made in China.

Can Kids Still Read Kipling?. I got this so that my husband could read stories to my 10-year-old granddaughter -- he loves to read, she loves to be read to. Kipling provides adventure and different cultures, so I figured it would entertain them both. I had not factored in how limited our vocabularies are today. My husband had to stop frequently to explain words; occasionally, he would have to look one up. They both still enjoyed the stories. (I also think it did my granddaughter good to learn that even grown ups have to look up words; there is no stigma to using a dictionary -- or in our case, the internet.)I would recommend the book to anyone who wants their child to achieve a high score on the verbal SAT, but I think a child would be better off to have it read to him than to read it solo.The book itself is large and heavy (hardback), but the print is a comfortable size.!ref!1,0,-100
Works as advertised - just set your charge cycle properly. Nineteen months after using this battery everyday, it's now showing some signs of wear. Occasional reconditioning restores some capacity, but from a high of about 2.5 hours, am now down to 40 mins per charge, all things being equal.I've modified the cycle, as suggested by the IBM Battery Maximizer app, hoping this will extend the life some more. Apparently, if you're plugged in most of the time, it's better to get the charger to stop at less than 100% capacity, and start recharging at below 90% capacity.Nothing wrong with the battery, really.

ABSOLUTELY ANGRY. I love The Golden Girls. I had this set bought for meThe Golden Girls - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7)because it is obviously all of the seasons that were released individually but together in one package. The only problem is that when I get them I put the first disc in and started out working great! That is...it played perfectly...until the 5th episode and then decides that it doesn't want to work any longer and starts skipping large chunks of episodes. I am absolutely furious! Seeing as how it was ordered for me I don't know who to get in touch with, whether any of the other discs are going to be problematic (it is a 21 disc set!), and whether or not I'll be able to get an exchange or if they will even work.That said, save yourself some trouble and go out to a store and buy the seasons individually. At least then you'll have a better chance of them working properly. You may even save money in the end that way. I just want discs that work!!ref!0,0,-100

Poor Quality. Better Puppets available. This Puppet is not as plush as it appears in the photo. It is actually made from a very thin material which does not hold its form. As a consequence when using the puppet the dog's head is crumpled and distorted and his eyes collapsed back and barely visible. I have tried to bolster the head by stuffing it with paper towels but it doesn't seem to be a good fix. Additionally the puppet does not seem to be sized for adult hands. I have medium sized hands and can barely get my hand comfortably into position to move the mouth. I have collected 6 puppets including this one which I use to play with my son. Of the six this puppet is the only one which doesn't get used. I would definitely recommend the Melissa & Doug line of hand puppets over this one.

Vampirism as a lifestyle. This film has very good acting and directing. You would be hard pressed to find so differently with the stars at hand in the picture. The movie focuses on a more dramatic side of vampires, over the classic horror view; however this works in its advantage. It does not overglorify nor does it over dramatize the life of vampires, as one would imagine it to be. This is the way the average person SHOULD think of vampires. Not Twilight, and not 30 Days of Night either. If you want to know what it is to be a vampire, the way you it probably would be if they existed, then this film is for you.!ref!1,0,-100

Wire pokes out. I am a full-figured woman and the underwire on this bra sticks out near the closure no matter how I try to adjust the fit. I bought the bra because I was having a problem with my shoulder that makes putting on a bra with the hooks in the back very difficult. I generally don't wear underwire bras since I find them uncomfortable. On the plus side, this bra is fairly easy to put on and to snap closed and it is comfortable. On the negative side, I have to wear it under a very loose top because the underwire sticks out so far. I would not recommend this bra.!ref!0,0,-100
Excellent guide to pitfalls on spiritual path.

As someone from more of a theravada background, it was interestingto get such a concise and lucid introduction to mahayana and vajrayana ideas.Trungpa is not a lightweight in his ideas, his presentation is forceful, and he has a clear idea of how things are.

A Nice Showcase for Beatles MUSIC!. I took my children to see this movie when it was first released. They were Frampton and BeeGees fans and didn't really listen to the Beatles. I, however, owned every Beatles album in existance as I now own the CD's. I never saw why the reviewers hated this movie and it's accompanying album. The music was very well done, every song. If you wanted the Beatles then this was not for you, but if you liked Beatles music then the performances were fine. I loved George Burns' rendition of "I'm Fixing A Hole Where The Rain Comes In" and many of the other performances were great for the novel performances of the original Beatles music. If you wanted great acting and directing, well then this movie is not for you. It's not a very good movie.

breathtaking. i've just re-started beading after a hiatus of about ten years, so i am not familiar with recent beading books and can't compare this to any other overviews that might be out there.however, in and of itself, this is a beautiful, well-illustrated, far-ranging work. africa is well-represented. north AND south american indian work is represented, including the work of the inuit and northwestern nations. there is a section on greenland beadwork, short, but more than i have found yet. asia, india, oceania, the middle and near east and europe have their sections. the final section is a brief but reasonably adequate, description of techniques.the photos are breathtaking. and dangerous. i have already mentally designed at least five new projects. the only complaint i have is the lack of dating for some of what are probably 19th century postcards and photos and for what may be relatively recent photos.i think this would be a worthwhile addition to even extensive beading collections.!ref!1,0,-100

Good but not a real mystery. Lots of interesting details about what goes on behind the scenes at the Metropolitan & the Natural History Museum, but a really weak mystery plotline. _NO_ knowledge of Africa at all, just New York PC views. They're two different things. Willem van der Post's death is pure Hollywood -- anyone with any knowledge of Africa would just burst out laughing. The author also knows nothing about Continental names. 'Van der' is Dutch & any name which contains it is perfectly ordinary. 'Von' is Austrian & is always part of an aristocratic name. Also note that 'van der Post' would be listed under 'P', _not_ 'v'. I mention this because it's a significant point in the plot at the end.

(I'm editing my review) I was a little wary of that release date, however I now have the 3 disc DVD in my hands. 22 episodes of fun & laughter.On the box it says full screen, however I have a widescreen TV and I was expecting to see black borders on either side of the picture but instead the picture fills up the whole of the TV without looking stretched. Yippeee. There are no subtitles. Is it strange that I love this show yet think Cheeers is nothing special?!ref!1,0,-100
Missing pages. Purchased this 'New" from Collect Musings - a Calif. bookstore through Amazon. Book looked great with a pristine dust cover. However, pages 33 to 46 are not in the book.

Do not buy this toy.. Our child also loves this toy but the tractor only lasts for about a week before it starts breaking down. We have brought the tractor back THREE TIMES and have yet to get one that works for longer than a week. It's a real shame that the manufacturer can't make this toy durable enough to last.

Quotable Runner fan. The Quotable Runner is not just a book; it's like having a knowledgable running companion on call 24/7. The book was a fun read and easy to stop then pick up again when I had a chance. I took the book with me everywhere I went so I wouldn't miss an opportunity to read a few pages when I had some down time.As someone who enjoys-but struggles with-running, I drew a great deal of inspiration from this little treasure trove of quotes.

IN Person. Tony Bennett is one smooth singer. Having been a star, a has been, and a retro-icon, he has known every degree of fame, and deserves all the kudos his recent renaissance has afforded him.Tony isn't one to blow you away. He's more quiet ocean breeze than tsunami, and is a master of under delivery. You don't realize how good he is until you hear a certain phrase or note that simply demands attention.What a selection of melodies, all great, all well known. Sung in the Bennett style, delivery first class, arrangements very good. Recording quality very impresive . Bennett is a professional,!ref!1,0,-100
Bump To The Funk. Putting things in context, you could compartmentalize "The Twist" as being BIG BIG in the early 60s, and then disco came along in the ~ mid 70s. That left a lot of years in between, roughly from 1963-1974. "Tighten Up" is likely the most easily recognizable dance tune from that whole period.Yes it's ironic & sad that the song was released in early April, 1968; that being said perhaps one can remember it as the tune that kept us along going & dancing during that period. I certainly do. I can't possibly remember how many times I got together with a group of kids & just danced away, and let all the troubles & injustices of the world melt away.Additionally, this song introduced the "funk sound" that became so prevalent particularly from about 1968- 1973. Then came disco. Enough said!!!ref!1,0,-100
Some reading hints for this disappointing book. I was disappointed by this long Clancy book. I did notice his writing begin to slip with Rainbow Six, but at this point, I think he's done for. Still, I'll probably keep reading his books like many others. Here are two hints to save time when you read this book.1. This is a great opportunity to try your speed reading. I promise you that no passage in this book needs to be read carefully.2. As soon as you see Cathy Ryan in the book, skip the section altogether (these sections have no relevance whatsoever and repeat things we all know from prior books). Depending upon how quickly you read, this could save you an hour or so.Hopefully, Tom Clancy's next book reverses this trend.!ref!0,0,-100
Long Time User. I've been using Kelocote for nine months at my surgeons recommendation for some new, large scars. It's hard to really say how much it helps with the appearance of the scars since I don't know what would've happenend without it but my gut tells me it has helped some. I still have some nasty keloid scars but they seem to be softening.One thing I am certain about is that it has helped with the soreness and itching that can come with new scars. I've had very little of that.Make sure you use it right. A little goes a long way. Don't over-cover the scars. You should barely be able to feel that it's there. A common mistake.I definitely would recommend this or the Scar Away patches if you prefer. They're decent too.!ref!1,0,-100
The Best Beatles Story. When I first was introduced to the Beatles music, I loved it right away because of the sound and mood it gave. I was so impressed with the fab 4 that I went to the library as soon as possible to find out a little about them. I happened to come across the best Beatles story available. The Love You Make told each detail as someone living the story would see it...that's because the author did live it. The Peter Brown from 'The Ballad of John and Yoko' wrote the book. I was hooked till the end. Since then, I've read several other books about the Beatles, but none have come close to being as good as this one. If you want to know the true story of the Beatles, this is the book you should choose!!ref!1,0,-100
Mediocre. There was once a time where the brand ALVIN meant you were getting a good product.This is a very lightly constructed lamp. Since I work with the same materials it's built from I can easily reinforce it where it's weak. For the average buyer however, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.The arms are light gauge square steel tube and are not very sturdy.The lens, while is it indeed glass it is meager at best, with strong chromatic aberration when viewing through the lens at anything but 20 to center.The springs are very weak.The lamp head is injection modeled ABS and it is not very well gusseted. There is a great deal of flex.As of 1-2-2013 I've had the lamp nearly four months and made five modifications; the head housing of the lamp, and the friction binding for the head itself, head shade, the mount post and surface mount.All in all, it's worth exactly what it costs, and no more.If you want something that will last for years, this is NOT the one to buy.!ref!0,0,-100

A Well-Made Book!. This book would have to be one of the best books I have ever read! I couldn't put it down, and all my friends are now reading, and loving it! It is the story of a nameless mute, the lowest of the low, who escapes from servanthood, only to find it is a girl! It is a story of self-discovery, love and friendship, all in a beautifully woven story, whose plot twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I recommend it to anyone who remotely likes fantasy (although some of my friends who have never read fantasy in their lives loved it) or anyone who loves a great book. The second one in the series is wonderful too, and I am just about to get reading on the 3rd book. Happy reading!!ref!1,0,-100

Manufacturer ruined this product. We had purchased several of these cases. They were great. Then the manufacturer decided to redesign them and make a case of far less quality. It is very disappointing.Like Beverly McCarty said: "It is flimsy material around the zipper, there is no carry handle, the case size itself is smaller." It does not have the rings inside anymore either.I called the company and they confirmed that the product was changed yet they kept the same price.**I would not recommend this product anymore.**!ref!0,0,-100
Pirates. I've played the Demo for this title and it is Sid Meyers Pirates redone or as close as it can get without violating copywrite laws. It has almost everything the original Pirates had.

A Gift from John. When i first heard about this album I had a brief moment of dread. Take a bunch of songs I love and give them the "guest star remake" treatment--you know, "Sam Stone" as a duet with Sting.No such worries anymore. These are the real songs, plain as can be, plainly and sparely arranged and played by regular guys--no bells and whistles. Very few songwriters write songs that could withstand such treatment. Prine's songs shine like burnished gold, but then he's always been good at leaving things out. Who else could sum up an entire relationship with, "Well ya know she still laughs with me/But she waits just a second too long."These are fifteen of the man's best, which is to say fifteen of the best songs ever written by anyone. Every home should have more than one John Prine album, but this would be an excellent start. For long time fans who love the songs, it is a rare and generous gift from one of the great singer/songsriters of all time.Thanks, John.!ref!1,0,-100

fav book. I bought this book when I was living in THE city on the lower east side about four years ago. I could swear that the guy who sold it to me was Fred Savage. I purchased it because of the cover, and the description on the back, and the charm of the old seller. (Old paperback copy with trippy picture) It was the best 50cents-$1.00 I ever spent. I won't go on about the book because from reading other reviews here, the story either crawls inside your dreams and mind and causes the most longing, wondrous sense of deja-vu, or it bores you. It is very close to my heart. There is no piece of art , literary or otherwise that has affected me so much.!ref!1,0,-100
Extremely poor quality. The lowest quality item I have ever received from Amazon. Board is made of cheap, splintering pine. Holes are not neatly drilled.

A Manufacturing Book That Applies to Many Industries. I first read the book while working at an electric utility, Florida Power and Light. While enjoying it immensely, I didn't see its application to what we were doing. Several years later, while consulting with a hospital, I "saw" that their medical records department was having the same problems Alex Rogo had in his plant. Their "product" is the generation of a patient bill, developed by "processing" the patient's medical records. I enouraged the director to read THE GOAL, we then proceeded to improve the throughput of her operation by identifying "Herbie", addressing batch issues, etc. Now I look for "Herbies" everywhere!!ref!1,0,-100

Republishing older books - a disappointing sales strategy.

Waste of money and disappointment in this author whose novels usually offer a nice little get-away. I'll be more careful in the future of pre-ordering her "new" books!
