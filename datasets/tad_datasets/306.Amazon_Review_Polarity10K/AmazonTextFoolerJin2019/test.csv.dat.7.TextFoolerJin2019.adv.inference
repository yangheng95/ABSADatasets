Wonderful Blankly at Gay Life in the British Fifties. Neil Bartlett's The House on Brooke Street is a wonderfully written seem at the repressive 1950's in Britain. It has the erotic charge and the creepy paranoid (with good reason) fear mixed in equal measures to make this novel feel vivid and practical. The unnamed lead chararcter takes the reader through his encounters and furtive loves through the decades to when he typewritten it all down in 1956 in a very compulsive signifies that is disappointing and lonely with the thin shadows of anger, rebellion and triumph creeping in on the edges. It is an evocative look at a time but also a look at a time about to change. A very knowing, readable novel.!ref!1,1,0
One estrella. Great pictures (for black and pai), including of the tombs of some of the great Chinese Muslim saints; but regarding persuaded the perpetrators displays very little interest/appreciation for the churches of Islam; he presents a literature that is quite "fuzzy around the edges," with very lesser regard for the vast wealth of Islamic/Sufi tradition in China, including the Naqshbandiyya (Khuffiyya/Jahriyya) and Qadiriyya orders.

interesting. I thought the book, being short, was too done. I'm not a tolkien, the man, fan, myself, I just like the books he wrote. It was short enough to keep me interested and didn't go into tolkien worship. He was a man just like any of us. White didn't go into intense depth like some of the other authors, who border on tolkien worship. This book is for those who want to skim his life, his associations, like C.S. Lewis, his wife, etc., to see who he really is really quickly and go on. The few supposed 'errors' as some other reviewers put it, are completely outweighed by the many facts put forth by the author that paint the picture as it is done in other works, but at 30,000 feet. Like I said before if you want more depth and concise tolkien history go to some other book.!ref!1,1,0

One of my all dated favorite Jane Austen movies. "Persuasion" is a wonderful literature and this is a grandiose filming version of the book. I had a VHS print of this for years and eventually grabbed up the DVD.The cast is smudged on - without "big" names to which the script is molded around. It is very true to the booklets - and mentions in the spectator a lingering wistfulness of what possibilities had been.My recommendation is to read the book first and then see the movie to see the characters brought to life.

The lower in an otherwise decent serial. His seem to ai the habit of most fantasy writers (or perhaps their eds) to forever stick with the characters and worlds that made them famous; this pattern can be witnessed over and over again in the fantasy genre (see R.A. Salvatore, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, et al). The wake, unfortunately, is usually livres adore this. One gets the think that even Brooks has grown tired of the series. The intrigue is nothing any faithful reader of Brooks isn't familiar with by now, and the literary execution is, to say the least, uninspired. Sadly, however, I'm sure that as I write this, Terry's publishing company is pressuring him to come up with yet another Shannarra novel, perhaps this time an epilogue to the series.

The acting is atrocious and the story is cliche and oh so predictable (for the most part), but Buried Alive does have a few good moments of note, including some nifty gore effects and a small role from Saw's Tobin "Jigsaw" Bell, who himself up's the creep factor just by appearing on film.

During there, things went from bad to worse. The pounds depressed me, possibly because it addresses the afterlife and I was just looking for a good inspirational read. I also had trouble understanding if Ms. Hunt was really trying to describe hell, purgatory, or was merely using poetic license to get readers to take stock of their relationship with God. If the latter is the case, she succeeded.

Overwhelming guide but needs updating. This book is grandiose for both the novice and experienced eBayer alike. Everyone who uses eBay regularly should be able to take something away from this book.As a previous reviewer has stated, some of the tips are common sense, and come straight off the ebay site. However, its great to have these tips in one place and easily referenced. This can serve as a checklist for your own buying and selling procedures.PS: Second edition has now been released. Make sure you are buying the new one.The one big negative - no coverage of the latest 'bid sniping software'. This automates your bidding, allows better planning, does not increase the sell value early in the auction and maximizes the chance of winning (by placing a bid in the last seconds of auction). This software isn't highly publicized by ebay.This is a great book, but look out for newer texts covering the latest auction software.!ref!1,1,0

A Good Knot Book. This book gives conspicuously illustrated instructions on tying many very useful knots. It organizes them under headings of Sailing, Hiking and Climbing in which they are most commonly used. The author includes the strength of most of these knots which describes how much they weaken the lines in which they are tied - often leaving less than 50% of the original strength of the line! Some knots do not hold well when bending (you will learn the definition of this term, as well as "hitch" and "knot") together two ropes of unequal size. Maybe you should use a different knot?

Time Travel & Pseudo-Scientific Jargon. Spells travel and what-have-beens are among my favorite write of book. Highly recommended are Anderson's TIME PATROL, Piper's LORD KALVAN or Dann's TIMESHARE series.However, Senhor.

Fun, but does SANS contain words that you can use every day. I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a book full of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day.!ref!0,1,1

Unprejudiced Warns. Okay, okay, how do I chitchat this reverently? This book is all but unfathomable. Period. But not for the reason(s) you might think. The author is British. I am a not, and frankly, half the time while traipsing through this book, I didn't have a clue as to what this writer was talking about. You see, that's because the book is written a la "British humor". British humor combined with late 20th century British slang terms, references, in-country gossip, yada, yada,yada. It's a book written by a Y2K Brit for fellow Y2K Brits. While his stories of previous Tour races are interesting and well written, so much of the rest of the book, like I said before, had me more than once thinking, "What is this guy talking about??"All you Anglophiles can turn up your noses if you wish, but I personally would not recommend this book.

A memorandum to this zi.. It'a A Grandiose Day opened for Stephenson Carat in the first fieldhouse unanimity i was ever at as a freshmen at the University of Iowa in Iowa City,Ia. It was Oct.or Feb.of 1970. Neither when we heard that violin sound, we were blown away. Speech about Laila, and Stairway To Heaven sure. But in my mind, White Bird is adequate up there as a song for all time. The beginning plucks to the violin strings at the beginning of the song bring a wide smile every time i hear it. And it was just the beginning of so many wonderful shows at the fieldhouse, the Duane Allman Memorial Fieldhouse. It has always been great to be a Hawkeye but it was especially great in the days from '70-'74. Check this album out. Acehigh!ref!1,1,0
Twenty Three Years Later.... We might know "Airport 75" right? Now Twenty Three years later, we have "Turbulence." Both are 747s, both have no pilots, both have to make emergency landing. This cinema should have been aptly named "Airport 97." The only actor that could take a beating was the 747 itself. Everyone else was clueless and unattainable. Only if stewardesses were given pilot licenses. Lauren Holly didn't need the hairspray that Karen Black needed in 75.!ref!0,1,1

Cheaper Further TurboTax, But Not Useful It. I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better. Formerly I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprising how much clumsier of a program it was to use. I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly. I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax. I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years "Do Not Buy Tax Cut" so that I wouldn't forget.If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK.!ref!0,1,1
Blows. This album really coups, and that's all I got to say about that. Well first of all, the academia wants to pass this guy as a rocker, which he is not, he is straight up pop. Rockers write their own songs, they don't rip off other people's songs.!ref!0,1,1

Large Music!. This was a lot of party music which is good for parties and a couple of slow paroles. "Get the Party Started" has a great defeats and great singing. "Don't Let Me Get Me" is another glorious song and proclaimed that you shouldn't let people try to change. Except you like party music you'll love this CD. that is all, Good-bye.!ref!1,1,0

The LCD screen breaks easily & not worthwhile the cost to fix. Analog as others with the breaking LCD screen what a bummer they should do some sort of testing with pressure placed on the screen and have to meet a minimum force to breakdowns. me like the camera other than that. Slim and long lasting battery user affable It would have cost $130 to recharged back and replace the screen I can get a youngest one on e bay for that once I won't learned Olympus cameras any more. I am going to try Sony now.!ref!0,1,1

A handsome looking, workplace tea kettle. What is there to say about a tea kettle? it administering the tea making just okay. The design is overall appealing, especially since I have matching teacups from another company. Like another review said, this comes with a removable whistle over the spout, not the lever.Cons: Besides the lack of the lever from the picture, the whistle is not very loud at first, so take that as a pro or swindling as you see fit.Also, the whistle is not going to work unless you completely close the top of the lid, and properly secure the whistle to the spout. Otherwise the steam just flows out random openings and does nothing.Only other downside is that the top of the kettle is kind of hard to remove, especially if you can only grip the little black nob due to heat.Overall, a working, good looking, teakettle, but I bought this for about half price. I wouldn't suggest it for its normal price though. If your going to spend over fifty dollers for a kettle, make sure its one you want.!ref!1,1,0
