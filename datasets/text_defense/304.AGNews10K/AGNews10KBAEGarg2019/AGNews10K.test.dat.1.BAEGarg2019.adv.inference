Open Letter Against British Copyright Indoctrination in Schools The British administration for Education and Skills (DfES) recently launched a ""Music Manifesto"" campaign, with the ostensible intention of educating the next generation of British musicians. Unfortunately, they too teamed up with the music industry (EMI, and various musicians) to drive this popular. EMI has apparently negotiated their end well, so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music.The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little, so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it. Unfortunately, it's pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives. But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area.!ref!3,1,2
