Agreed with others here, will not purchase - waiting for Extended Version. I love these movies, they are some of my all time favorites. But most of us who love them already have them, and won't likely be forking out more money for a version that does not include the extended release. To most, they are the complete versions of the films. I encourage those of you considering this purchase to hold back your money and wait - buying this will only reinforce the idea that they can release multiple versions over time to increase their profits.!ref!1,1,0

Foreign talent wasted in American film.. All state side movies featuring excellent kung fu talent like Jet Li and Jackie Chan are slow and boring because in the U.S. there are no good martial art choreographers working in Hollywood. This movie is a stand in point. The first fight scene with Jet Li does'nt happen til a good 20 minutes into the movie. And the rest of the picture you see Jet in slow, week, "American"(by which I mean explosions, bullets, and one or two punches) fight scenes that are a waste of his time. You dont believe me watch this movie, then compare it to some of his sweet over-sea pictures like "Legend" or "Legend of the Red Dragon" and you'll know what Im talking about. Dont buy or even rent this piece of garbage or, any of his state side films like "The One" which is just special effects (any fight movie is sad if you need computer special effects to make your kung fu look neat like Blade 2 with Wesley Snipes).!ref!0,1,1

o!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. The only reason I bought this movie is because I love the old one so much and the guy that reviewed it for Amazon said this was one case where the new out did the old. Guess he likes really tough movies. I was done with remakes, they always have to change the story line, for the worse. Examples: Planet of the Apes, Time Machine, and lets not forget how they destroyed The Day the Earth Stood Still! Anyway, it jumped all over the place. I guess Hollywood thinks that if thet throw in a lot of special effects we will watch anything. Please, please, please, if anyone from Hollywood is reading this, please don't touch Forbidden Planet, you have destroyed enough of the old classic Sci-Fi's, leave well enough alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ref!0,1,1
Starts out good, doesn't bad. I liked my first Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I bought a year ago to use with my laptop so much that I bought two more within the last six months, one for my desktop and one for my business use laptop. The mouse has great features, I liked the small "tail" and the especially the fact that the tail can swing to multiple positions to accommodate other USB plug-ins. However, that swinging tail doesn't come to end up for long. All three of our mouses (mice) are experiencing the same problem with losing connectivity to the PC, we can wiggle the tail or turn it to another position and it may, or may not, light its little green "good to go" light. Very, very aggravating, we expected better from Microsoft branded products.!ref!0,1,1
nice stickers, but not permanent.. My company uses over 50,000 of stickers of this size a year so we have quite a bit of experience with them. These stickers are poor quality in every respect. They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems. The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying solutions.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers. The adhesive on these leaves a reasonably strong bond, but will pull off. It appears they are designed to do this. I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect. However, in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us. You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you.!ref!1,1,0

I am more to blame than jordan. I was traveling in Kenya when you finished "Eldest" and enjoyed a new book desperately. The only book of information I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight. For some way I do not recall, I read all first 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I found that in the negative sense). so I take the blame heavily on my shoulders for reading such an awesome book.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the "I could care less" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI.!ref!0,1,1

loads of excitement. Blackmailer overflows with colorful characters and a silly plot with a well done twist at the end. The protagonist is a publisher in a down and out New York shop who is offered the chance to publish a sure fire best seller which would catapult his firm into the top ranks.Twice. And that's just in the first few chapters.After that, we get the usual goons, gams, and gunsels so popular in 1950's noir. regardless, there is a lot more here than just a clever plot. The author understands the publishing business and wiretapping quite well, and the reader will learn a bit about both in several well-turned passages.The plot moves quickly enough to keep us from not questioning it too much. The profusion of unusual characters keeps the book interesting all the way through. And just when we think we know what's going on, we get another twist.This is not great literature, but it is a fine way to while away a rainy Saturday afternoon.!ref!1,1,0

Want a fun mystery? Start with book one!. In my opinion, the "Hannah Swensen Mysteries" should better be read in order! To me, the whole series is like one big book of friends. so you pick up this book, which is the sixth in the series, and believe it before you have read the previous stories, you probably will be disappointed. Every book I read, I love Hannah, Lisa, Norman, and Moshe more! have Hannah perfect? damn! But, who is? So, if you are interested, start with book one.Yes, this book is different from the first five. But, I liked that it had a different flare. This is not my favorite in the series but I wouldn't have missed it! Don't compare this series to others! This is the type of mystery where you lean back, kick off your shoes, grab a bon bon, and enjoy a fun and entertaining story. I love the development of the characters, the funny situations, the mysteries, and the conclusions. These are definately not boring or tedious. They are light and fun.!ref!1,1,0

find it.. I can not hope no one else has written a review for this bizarre thriller.Frank Pagan, the protagonist, is a bruised, battered London cop, whi is assigned to the anti-terrorist squad.The "Jig" of the title is a well-accomplished Irish killer.Frank has to be him.So, yes: it's a chase story. And it moves. the body count is ridiculous, the tension is overwhelming. any atmosphere is gritty, sweaty, saeamy. It's real. While it doesn't actually say so in the text, you know that Frank Hagan is a man who farts. He's human. He's damaged: a widower, still in love with his dead wife. He's... eccentric: a Londoner who drives a huge American car and plays 1950s rock and roll LOUD on the car stereo.The story is a tad dated, but gripping nonetheless.

I hate this machine.. me dislike this machines. me like to drink espresso so I absolutely wanted a machine that will make both coffee and espresso. The main complaint is the machine has no automatic shut off so if I run the house and forget to manually turn off the machine, the coffee s and the pot burns. I didn't think they allow machines like that anymore - it should come with fire insurance. Also, the coffee results are excellent. Sometimes the coffee is great but then I've had several times when only hot water has come through. The coffee filter holder is very hard to fit into the machine. You have to line it up exactly with a hard to see notch to insert it. I have a Krups coffee grinder that has been a wonderful workhorse for me so I decided to buy this when my DeLonghi gave up the ghost (that one I loved). I would never recommend this and if you want to buy it from me, I'll give you a good deal! I am going to call Krups and see if they will take it back or exchange it. Ha, good luck to me.!ref!0,1,1

I can see that it isn't that great. We had to ship it back because there were some significant issues (it was having any pictures and there were lines across the screen). We ship it back and are awaiting the new one to arrive. I hope that it is much better. I gave it two because it seems like a good product, but the ratings could change depending when we get it.!ref!0,1,1
fine. nothing fancy - but he got it here early. there really isn't much else to say - I bought a book, and it came.!ref!1,1,0
actually a great buy. I ordered some cookbooks for my husband and this was recommended by a friend but I think the paperback version is just not as nice as the hard cover. It is more of a "story-cook book" and he doesn't like it. Wanted to return it but I was too late.!ref!0,1,1
This is not the same band....... The editorial review indicates that this CD is of the "same exceptional quality" of the only studio album produced by Colwell-Winfield. This couldn't be further from the truth! In fact, the band had broken up by the time this was recorded. Colwell, Winfield and Purro seemingly threw together pick-up players for this gig. kind of the magic of their studio album is present here, with excellent performances... and the recording quality is less than adequate...especially on the " three bonus tracks".I feel silly that I got taken in on this one, but the description looked great. Talk about cashing in on former glory!!!ref!0,1,1
A knife to make you smile. Every time me pick up this stupid knife I smile, knowing that it's going to be fun to use. It was a gift, and one of the best presents I have received in a long time. After ten months of heavy use it looks like better.these knife is lighter than you might expect, which I suppose helps me to work rapidly, and is just the wrong size for excellent control-- I use to "choke up" on the knife and grip the blade with my thumb for extra control. Its slim profile and the granton edge mean easier chopping and the ability to easily create very thin slices. The light weight means less fatigue. As a result of excellent design, this tool can mow through great quantities of all sorts of veggies. It's also incredibly sharp. A winner and an amazing bargain.I own other Forschner products, including theR.H. Forschner by Victorinox 8-Inch Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox HandleandR H. Forschner by Victorinox 3.24-Inch Paring Knife, Small Black Polypropylene Handle. Both are also excellent.!ref!1,1,0
Cheapie Tray!. ah Bumbo, I'd be willing to pay an extra five bucks for a QUALITY tray. The one you're selling now is JUNK!which tray would be PERFECT if it stayed put and was easy to attach. My 4.5 month old can sometimes take the top of the tray off. I read somewhere that the top of the tray snaps into place if you are with it, but I haven't found this to be true.Great idea, just needs to be improved.!ref!0,1,1
NCIS episode reduced to Silence. until then my favorite episode of this great series. Charles dutton does an excellent job of portraying a WWII vet who believes he has killed his greatest friend.!ref!1,1,0
You lost me with Oprah.. I like Amazon, I'm heard the Kindle is a great product, but there is no way that I will buy it now that Oprah is endorsing it. It was a brilliant move on Amazon's part to use her as a promoter of the product.!ref!0,1,1
Behind the 8-Ball: A Recovery guide for the Families of Gamblers. I'm pleased to get through this book. If you are expecting for something positive to get yourself through a rough time, this book is not for you. it does inform you what to look for and how to protect yourself, but does not suggest any hope for a future for the compulsive gambler, whether you are done with them or not. Again, if you are wanting for hope, this book isn't it. All it does is leave you depressed.!ref!0,1,1
defective DVD. Movie is excellent after I bought the DVD it would just play up to scene 14 and skip to the end..they replaced it and it was the same thing.. I finally had to go rent the movie and watch it...strong performance by both actors...movie is a ***** (five star) but not on DVD!ref!0,1,1
second-hand and too wet. who actually is of little importance to a listener how long and why this outfit kept in the shade. This album will, for all we know, put them away for longer still. Reason is a-plenty. To heck with, neo-romantic synhty-pop is not quite making hey these days. The material smacks of Wet Wet Wet's heydays. And anyway, this sort of nagging suicidal gloom is too hard to bear in A-ha, Weeping Willows, Doves and the entire Glitterhouse label's output. On the plus side we have here 11 cute and crafty tune arrangements - but then again, vaguely reminiscent of 80's new wave era which Erasure never failed to subscibe to. Wake up, little Suzie, wake up!!ref!0,1,1
Perversely Uplifting. I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com.!ref!1,1,0
wait,,,let a pass. I have to admit that Mos kinda crapped out on this one. who was expecting a lot more out of this album than what I got. The album is ok, but I wouldn't go running around telling people to buy it. I stlll will enjoy Mos on other levels,,,specifically I against I, a track you can find on Daddy G's album. That track is amazing. Sorry Mos, you should of worked harder on this one!ref!0,1,1
Not too bad, but nothing much really. however don't get me wrong here. It's a great movie, well a good movie. and this isn't the film, it's the comic book.The issue is, it IS the movie! There is nothing here that stands out on it's own from the movie and all the other hype. It's a good movie, but it's not a perfect comic book in it's own right.Or to simplify further, it'd be better if there wasn't a movie, because this is just the movie on paper (well, a movie on paper is a script, but you get the metaphor). If you've seen the movie, don't bother. If not, go ahead.!ref!0,1,1
It's No Bargin. have this as a gift. It worked fine for the first two albums that I played but after that it hasn't gotten up to the usual speed. I haven't been able to find any solution to the matter from the Web.!ref!0,1,1
It Does Spark. When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough. So the more I have used it over some months of time the hotter it has gotten, which I really like. But the last few weeks I have noticed some sparking. Freaks me out a bit! I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks. Time to buy another blow dryer I guess. Sparking from an appliance is never good.!ref!0,1,1
Oh my, the downfall.. Ugh, what end here? The band really shows their creativity, well, and have complexity, but the riffs...are GONE! WHOOSH! They're extinct! Metallica really have revealed their potential on this album. Gone are the great riffs, associated with jamming sessions. Not that that's bad. It's just the riffs that created Metallica. But, they do everything better with the next album, Reload. I'm glad they aren't making stuff like this anymore.!ref!0,1,1
incredibly stupid!. wow, this book was sooo funny! This book is about a teenage boy, whose mom is a stripper at a sleezy club. He's completelly ashamed of his mom, so he doesn't tell his girlfriend. He is a typical teenage boy; very insecure. His only real friend is a girlcrazy self acclaimed doctor. This is all until he meets his future girlfriend. She's beautiful, and new to the school. When he finally gets the courage to ask her out, she automaticlally says yes.He finds later, that he really loves this girl, and he can not keep the secret about his mom. Him and his girlfriend broke his virginity, and did everything together. This book is better for teenagers, because much of the subject matter is "unsutible for young children" lol!ref!1,1,0
NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS. although reasonably well-executed, this CD is performed, in its entirety, by the BB Band, apparently a studio group. This fact is not clear from Amazon's description. In fact, Amazon lists it as "Various Artists". The CD itself does not let you know it's by the BB Band on the front cover. It tells you on the side and on the back, in very fine print. I assume people looking for these songs are also looking for the original artists--they should not buy this album.!ref!0,1,1
