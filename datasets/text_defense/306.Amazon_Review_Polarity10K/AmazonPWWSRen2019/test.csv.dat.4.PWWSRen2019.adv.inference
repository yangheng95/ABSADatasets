LOVE Jackie, Don't love the new Freddy.. I adore Jackie Earle Haley as an actor. He's one of the best, I actually enjoyed the whole cast, but I don't appreciate them trying to recreate Freddy. I understand that they were trying to make him scarier, but that's just not who Freddy is. He's a little scary at times, but he also likes to crack jokes at every opportunity. That's just who Freddy is, it doesn't work any other way. They might as well try to create a whole new villain with Freddy's MO... never mind, I don't want them doing that either. Just, leave Freddy alone. ROBERT FOREVER.!ref!0,1,1
Gold Toes Bermuda Socks. I eff these socks. For a few years, I have bought them at JC Penney's, but this year, they did not have the color I like -- stone. Stone-colored socks go veryGold Toe Women's Bermuda Turn Cuff Sock, size 9-11well with khakis, which I wear a lot. The Gold Toes website also does not show these socks in stone, just black and white, so I figure that stone-colored socks are no longer being made. That's why I bought 2 dozen pair.The socks are very soft, comfortable, and cozy, not too tight or too loose. I will miss them when they are gone. The photo that goes with this review may show the so-called "khaki"-colored sock. The stone sock is lighter in color and goes really well with most khaki or chino pants. The khaki-colored sock is too dark for most khaki or chino pants.!ref!1,1,0
Cannot stall listening to this performance. Time passes fast, and 1970 is a prehistorical age for this kind of music.I had the bad idea to buy this recording: Britten is directing this music disregarding his own annotations on the scores he adapted !! (I had to study them for a concert).But worst, soloists are singing in a tremendous "italian melodrammatic style" (as we say "with big potatoes in their mouth"). The chorus is too large, the tempo too slow, terribly slow. The brasses are untuned, the orchestra is not convincing at all.Dido and Aeneas follows the same destiny.Want to buy back my CDs :)?!ref!0,1,1

I was not yarn-dye. I realize that this was one of Nora Roberts' earlier books, so the fact that the writing was not as good did not surprise me. However, I was very dissapointed that she speant almost no time letting the readers see Seth's thoughts until the very end and then, in a very uncharacteristic move for Roberts, allows her heroin to forgive him without too much changing or apoligizing on his part. I think this was an interesting book to read because of the fact that it was so early into Roberts' career but as a novel, I was just not impressed.!ref!0,1,1

This thing will warmth your hale house and everything in it. I bought the 402b because it has HDMI switching, lots of input options, and hightly rated sound output. I also bought it because I have had a JVC audio system for 15 years and love it.The good part of the receiver is it's great specifications and HDMI support. The bad part is that it that the hardware is poorly executed. It is inexcusable to redact out a product that becomes too red-hot to touch after half an hour of use at normal sound volumes. JVC apparently thinks it's some kind of crime to put cooling fans in receivers. As a result, you get a box that is cool to the touch in standby, and so hot that you literally can't touch the top after half an hour of use. I had to drill extra holes in the back of my entertainment center, and am now out looking for a PC fan that I can run along side it.I would be surprised if I don't have a different receiver within the month.If you live in Alaska, go for it.

Always Writes Ahead Of The twist. Candace Bushnell always writes ahead of the curve. The women of Sex and the City were ahead of their time, and now Bushnell has shown us a new breed of women in Lipstick Jungle. These women are strong, powerful, successful, and flawed. They, like so many women today, are entrepreneurs in the corporate world. But what I especially screw about this script is the attention that Bushnell pays to their flaws. Nobody is perfect, and nobody was ever meant to be. These three women face the same difficulties as women everywhere: temptation, finding love, divorce, fear of failure, etc... And even though these women live in a world few of us will ever be part of, each still struggles to figure out what will truly make them happy.

Beautiful Word - worth persisting with. I picked up this book with great expectiations, having recently devoured Cloud Street, The Riders, Shallows, Scission and an Open Swimmer I was looking forward to more from my favourite writer.After the first couple of chapters I was struggling to like it, wonedring where he was going and why he was painting such poor characters and situations (I really don't like the way some authors potray the internet). It seemed a bit close to Shallows as well for.But then the story griped me. Being a West Aussie myself and having lived in most of the areas this book picked up on I could really identify with the landscapes and people as their characters developed.The story to me was one of how people lived their lives dealing with deaths and how letting go and realising that dead people are not more than they were and shouldn't be built up into images that restrict you living your life.!ref!1,1,0

terminate Kids tranquillise Read Kipling?. I suffer this so that my husband could read stories to my 10-year-old granddaughter -- he loves to read, she loves to be read to. Kipling provides adventure and different cultures, so I figured it would entertain them both. I had not factored in how limited our vocabularies are today. My husband had to stop frequently to explain words; occasionally, he would have to look one up. They both still enjoyed the stories. (I also think it did my granddaughter good to learn that even grown ups have to look up words; there is no stigma to using a dictionary -- or in our case, the internet.)I would recommend the book to anyone who wants their child to achieve a high score on the verbal SAT, but I think a child would be better off to have it read to him than to read it solo.The book itself is large and heavy (hardback), but the print is a comfortable size.!ref!1,1,0

I had this set bought for meThe Golden Girls - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7)because it is obviously all of the seasons that were released individually but together in one package. The only problem is that when I get them I put the first disc in and started out working great! That is...it played perfectly...until the 5th episode and then decides that it doesn't want to work any longer and starts skipping large chunks of episodes. I am absolutely furious! Seeing as how it was ordered for me I don't know who to get in touch with, whether any of the other discs are going to be problematic (it is a 21 disc set!), and whether or not I'll be able to get an exchange or if they will even work.That said, save yourself some trouble and go out to a store and buy the seasons individually. At least then you'll have a better chance of them working properly. You may even save money in the end that way. I just want discs that work!!ref!0,1,1

demote To The Funk. Putting things in context, you could compartmentalize "The Twist" as being BIG BIG in the early 60s, and then disco came along in the ~ mid 70s. That left a lot of years in between, roughly from 1963-1974. "Tighten Up" is likely the most easily recognizable dance tune from that whole period.Yes it's ironic & sad that the song was released in early April, 1968; that being said perhaps one can remember it as the tune that kept us along going & dancing during that period. I certainly do. I can't possibly remember how many times I got together with a group of kids & just danced away, and let all the troubles & injustices of the world melt away.Additionally, this song introduced the "funk sound" that became so prevalent particularly from about 1968- 1973.

axerophthol Gift from whoremonger. When i first heard about this album I had a brief moment of dread. Take a bunch of songs I love and give them the "guest star remake" treatment--you know, "Sam Stone" as a duet with Sting.No such worries anymore. These are the real songs, plain as can be, plainly and sparely arranged and played by unconstipated guys--no bells and whistles. Very few songwriters write songs that could withstand such treatment. Prine's songs shine like burnished gold, but then he's always been good at leaving things out. Who else could sum up an entire relationship with, "Well ya know she still laughs with me/But she waits just a second too long."These are fifteen of the man's best, which is to say fifteen of the best songs ever written by anyone. Every home should have more than one John Prine album, but this would be an excellent start. For long time fans who love the songs, it is a rare and generous gift from one of the great singer/songsriters of all time.Thanks, John.!ref!1,1,0

It is very close to my heart. There is no piece of art , literary or otherwise that has affected me so much.!ref!1,1,0
Extremely inadequate prize. The abject quality item iodin have ever invite from Amazon. plank is score of flashy, splintering yen. jam are not neatly bore. Includes a slight beautify of roleplay wit from a never-heard-of Chinese fellowship. Hinge on plank is easy. Case's metal idiom were inscribe. Another fine case of first caliber goods orgasm out of PRC. maybe a former expose token, as box had clearly been opened before.!ref!0,1,1
mellow on hyperbole - dead on details. Not worth the money as a technical reference or how-to book. Otherwise a pleasant read with some inpired pics and a very ecumenical overview of the process. Speaks, for the most part, to strawbale contruction as if strawbales are some naturally occurring thing harvested from the wild when are in fact a product of energy intensive industrial agriculture. break to provide important technical details such as estimating for coverage, application on masonry, frame and other 'natural' structures, guidelines for plaster preparation. If you already have building experience and skills there are far better reference books available to actually base work upon.!ref!0,1,1
zippo like original. i bought this spunky on the effrontery that it was work to be indentical to the original. NOPE!the technique bought are difficult to do.if anybody remembers how the acro circus worked, it was like ryan or alex would jump and spin, hit the enemy and you could either kick or punch them. in this gba version, alex/ryan just spins and spins like a bowling ball! i mean seriously you can spin your way to the end of the game. i beat the game once like that.this game doesn't even play like the original. atlus tweaked this game too much for my taste. if you had good feelings about the original NES game, i don't recommend playing this one. i feel really gipped about buying it.!ref!0,1,1

Now N' in the mix was awesome!! Justin Timberlake iz mine ladies thanks!!!ref!0,1,1
A Manufacturing Book That Applies to Many manufacture. I first read the book while working at an electric utility, Florida Power and Light. While enjoying it immensely, I didn't see its application to what we were doing. Several years later, while consulting with a hospital, I "saw" that their medical records department was having the same problems Alex Rogo had in his plant. Their "product" is the generation of a patient bill, developed by "processing" the patient's medical records. I enouraged the director to read THE GOAL, we then proceeded to improve the throughput of her operation by identifying "Herbie", addressing batch issues, etc. Now I look for "Herbies" everywhere!!ref!1,1,0

I'm static Wishing for "region II". Let's get the obligatory command out of the way now - "it's good to be the king".I remember enjoying this immensely back in the 80s, and am actually amazed I look this long to look for it on DVD. I'm really big on intelligent satire, which is one reason I enjoy Mel Brooks more than the rest of my family.I sum it up this way:- if you like "Napolean Dynamite" and "Jackass", I don't think you'll even notice most of the humor in this movie;- if you like "Police Squad" and "Monty Python", this is right up your alley.!ref!1,1,0
Not recommended for beginners. If you know nothing about javascript, it will be more like 'teach yourself in 6 months', as there is an assumption that you have previous object programming experience. Although well contrive and well written, this book really escape the stigmatise for beginners and, at least for myself, was disappoint.!ref!0,1,1
Christmastime nowadays was a winner!. The jersey is slap-up. The material is good quality. but wish what we'd recover in the depot.!ref!1,1,0
Dont languish your money.... This sounded too honest to be true and clap! It is. We apply it (for a sumptuous come of trio times) to floor our cards at a wed. So far the prongs have flex 2x and the harddrive take to be reformatted once. And since this matter actaully neglect at a wedding - wouldn't urge it to anyone. dear off purchase more menu.!ref!0,1,1
Espresso Divine. Very thwarted at this motorcar; I did the reseach, register all the customer's review, and the machine doesn't live up to the review. Don't know what to do with it heretofore. The milk just doens't heat up and the foam over flow, so will have to catch the heating process.!ref!0,1,1

republishing older Koran - a disappoint sales strategy. Frankly, I think Nora Roberts must be raking in decent money for her popular novels without having to resort to the rather sneaky republish strategies of books touted as "new" - and you buy them only to describe that - gee, golly, gosh - you've read them years ago and had expected something raw! macerate of money and disappointment in this author whose novels unremarkably tender a skillful little get-away. I'll be more careful in the future of pre-ordering her "new" books! Sorry, Nora, you just went down a few notches on my scale! The one star is for just this -- not the novel itself which, if not among her best, is a pleasant distraction on a rainy day with nothing else to do.!ref!0,1,1
I DIDN'T comparable. THE BEST OF THIS BOOK YOU HAVE ALL READY SEEN, embody THE NICE PICTURE IN THE COVER AND THE AMBISIOS TITLE OF THE BOOK. THE CONTENTS IS NOT TO MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WHITH THE TITLE. IT HAS A COLLECTION OF PROYECTS (NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BAD)TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR CAR, BUT NOT REALLY TO RESTORE. WHEN I ASKED FOR THIS BOOK I DIDN'T READ THE CUSTOMERS REVIEW SECTION, THE NEXT TIME I ASK FOR A BOOK I WILL FIRST READ THIS SECTION.!ref!0,1,1
Ms. Reichs: celebrate Your Day Job. Ms. Reichs is by profession a pathologist. Please don't give that up. This al-Qur'an has a cast as long as your arm, along with many biker clubs & their affiliates. Apparently Ms. Reichs believes bikers are all druggies or murderers. Not a good one in the bunch. Throw in Kit, her very corny nephew and you have the makings for a not so undecomposed refreshing.The story seems not to be able to stay focused. It begins to wander out of control. There are sub-stories to be had which deter the main story even further. The the novel just is not focused at all. 2/3 of the way through, I found I just didn't care how this thing turned out. Please, send Kit back to Texas, stay away from bikers & their clubs, focus on your profession & give us readers a gentle break!ref!0,1,1
slap-up price. I'm pleased by the packaging and the scent seems to be the original. capital price for that size.I would def buy this again and also recommend to others.!ref!1,1,0
I've seen all this before..... This movie is a ancestry of everything you've ever seen before.Avatar=Alien (with Sig. Weaver)+Star Wars 1(with blue but less annoying race of Jar Jar Binks)+Harry Potter(flying dragons)+Disney movies (over saturated color and animation)+Top Gun (what's with the US Marine's schtick in all these invade-um movies anyway?)Okay Mr. Cameron, I see that you are getting really good with computer animation....I get it (hence the additional star in the rating).The problem is that I sat there fore 2 hours, THINKING that I was watching computer animation.I'm off to see the Hurt Locker now....atleast there will be a decent story.!ref!0,1,1
slap-up basic primer for an AA. This piddling book is so helpful to old and new AA's in helping get over those old urges, low self-esteem and more. Some of the material is not covered any where else and is a really good book to use at half-way houses because it allows people to speak their feelings about what is going on with them via the topics covered in the book. From week to week, as people get sober, the subjects in this book allow them to express their progress and to begin to understand the journey that they are on in a very positive way.!ref!1,1,0
gross!. I bought this for my sister for her first baby and she loves it! I was looking for something with a little of pink in it, as she had a girl, and also something for her small space. She says it fits perfectly into her tiny apartment, and she loves the colors. But most of all, she loves that her baby loves to sleep in it - and she should know, her baby was coliky!!ref!1,1,0

Gossip of the tough sort. The writer says at the beginning that shilling refused to talk to him for this book so instead he seeks out ex-girlfriends, fired band members, relatives of those Bob supposedly done wrong (e.g. Phil Ochs) and records their mostly negative observations about Bob. If you deprivation to read a lot of rumors and Bob bashing along with a rehash of what has been printed in other biographies.....this Bob's for you!!ref!0,1,1
