Anyone who likes this scoop must not realize there are other scoops out there that would make the job 1000 times easier.The angle of the scoop is all wrong so you can't really get any leverage. It's no surprise to read reviews about the scoop breaking. It's just not made properly to be a scoop.

My Review of Holes is that Holes is all about a kid named Stanley Yelnats is accused of stealing shoes but he didn't, but Zero did and then he dropped it off a bridge, and it landed on Stanley. Stanley fell with the shoes and the police thought that he stole the shoes from the homeless shelter. So, the police caught Stanley and put him in the military camp called Camp Green Lake. And all you have to do there is just dig holes to find a mystery object that only the evil warden knows about.

The dutiful Rake. Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here, but her 5-star follow-up is way off. I will say this novel had such a skillful rootage. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that sunburn out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book. (Sigh.) This is not a horribly bad story, and it's not badly written, but I got more and more annoyed with the plot and with the characters as I read on. I just think Ms. Rolls is capable of much better storytelling than this.!ref!0,1,1

It is weather resistant but not water (or insect) proof. Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter.

Asleep at the Watch. Immerse yourself once again in the seafaring adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin as they roam the almost unexplored oceans of the early 17th century, and participate in the bittersweet "liberation" of Chile. The 85 year-old O'Brian's flawless dialogue and meticulous attention to detail makes this book -- like the rest of the series -- a historical tour de force. Unfortunately after 20 previous books, Aubrey and Maturin have few surprises left, and hundreds of pages filled with the impenetrable politics and minutia of daily naval life may be as stupefying as Dr. Maturin's regular doses of laudanum and hellebore for readers unaware that a great naval battle invariably lurks in the closing pages. O'Brian addicts will welcome another chance to visit their favorite characters, but people new to O'Brian should visit the earlier, fresher books of the series -- say "The Far Side Of The World."-- Auralgo!ref!0,1,1

perfect fizzle of right ear bud after two weeks of use.. I came across these to replace some cheap earbuds I got from the grocery store. I found these and was pleased with the price and the good reviews. I read some of the bad reviews, and noticed a lot were about this very problem.

unconvincing characters that work. Who else but Elmore Leonard could come up with a phony priest and an ex-con standup comic as his hero and heroine? I'm guessing the Catholic Church left its marks on him in one way or another because he's had Catholic characters in other books, most notably TOUCH and BANDITS. I went to Catholic school, and the title PAGAN BABIES alone was enough to stir memories and draw me in. (And a tip of the hat to the person who thought to put a mission box on the cover. Perfect!) Leonard unfolds this story of scammers and scumbags with a deft hand, giving us a generous helping of his signature humor and bull's eye dialogue. No one writes like him, and thank God he's so prolific. The man is a national treasure.!ref!1,1,0
practiced Enough To donjon Me spiel. Don't have to worry about batteries or re-charging batteries anymore. Since it's cheaper than the original ones, the material is expected to be tawdry too, especially for the buttons. But if you're just going after something that will wreak and hold you wreak then this should do. The wire is prospicient enough but I use a USB extension cable to pee-pee it longer and strain as Interahamwe as I want to.!ref!1,1,0

Looking for something efective. corrupt the product because last year my dog, a wonderful big Golden Retriever had a serious desease from ticks, and the products we had been using did not provide good enough coverage for ticks. Have applied it today because I just came back from the States and will see if it works.....our vet said it's very undecomposed, so we hope the dog will be effectively protected and able to go to his everyday walk, everywhere.!ref!1,1,0
Do not purchase, have a doze instead.. Lewis write cracking books, but this is not unmatchable of them.Liar's Poker was a great read, even read it a second time last Christmas. However, this new one trades on his reputation far more than the contentedness.Let's sustain to the sharpen - it's drill.!ref!0,1,1
Brecht's Alienation. The book is a commodity guide on tracing the evolution of the notion of alienation in theater. A different route from the naturalistic theater tradition, alienation aims at "extracting" emotions in theater and sticking with the message and aim of a toy. Peter Thompson's work indirectly traces the idea of showing that acting is just plain "acting". He does this by reviewing the various experiences of staging Brecht's classic "Mother Courage and Her Children". For actors dreaming to just plainly "act" in theater (acting a character and not being a character), the good is a good guide. For those dreaming to be the mother in Mother Courage and The Mother, Shente in The Good Person of Setzuan, and St. Joan in St. Joan of the Stockyards--learn from this book.!ref!1,1,0
disappoint. Gergen's hold is inundated with name-dropping, within baseball, and self-seeking monitor of his proximity to office and his regulate,,,although the evidence of whether any of the really mighty accepted his advice or were influenced by him in any meaningful room is scanty. inch my opinion, it has been his willingness to procure which has shit him a "bi-partisan" figure, rather than admittedly understanding or political savvy (a la Moynihan).unity find the book to be the same as the man,,,narcissistic and full of self-promotion. There are much better views inside Washinton.!ref!0,1,1
A bit slight. ravel of Years was my world-class experience with Anne Tyler. I was only mildly impressed, because I thought the development of the plot was a bit cut. The book incorporated many real-life situations and emotions, but Tyler was too vague in her descriptions. Tyler left too much to the reader's imagination, which made it a bit difficult to really connect with the characters. It was a constant think game throughout the book as too what Delia was really feeling. It was almost impossible because of lack of description to decipher the real reason for Delia leaving, and whether or not she was justifiable in doing so.!ref!0,1,1

Emancipate Us.. This cd is slap-up and the re-release promises to be better. It's worth the price just for the 5 videos you will have...Then 4 new songs.. What a package and Mimi fans don't heed at all..Heck it'll make a great gift for someone else if you already have it.!ref!1,1,0
Choppy - could have been better.... I jibe with other reviewers - II hours is insufficient. IT appear like the movie is infract into 3-5 hour segment of the most important conniption in the book. It's very choppy, speed, and doesn't very excuse anything. If you learn this (and haven't read the book), you're sledding to question what the hell happened between certain scenes. I opinion the cast was outstanding, but the movie just didn't flow. If you're looking for a good adaptation, check out one of the BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions; they never disappoint.!ref!0,1,1
Too regretful!. I place this al-Qur'an from the "employ Quran" section on 4/dozen/09. today is quintuplet/13/09 and one still let NOT experience IT. unity guessing this supplier wasn't such a dear option after all. TOO tough!!ref!0,1,1
capital Buy!. estimable backpack I've ever owned! muckle of useful pocket. If you're not sure what to put in all those pockets, it even has little square hardware symbol logos sewn into the inside of each pocket... and there's a legend in the main compartment that explains each symbol. The handle is a self-aggrandising plus. It break comfortably, and is crap of water resistant material. The Mp3 pouch halt an external HD perfectly, though it's weight makes the bag slouch, especially when the main compartment is open. The file pocket is great for keeping bills and other paperwork separate. Great design overall, my wife wanted it when I walked in with it on my shoulder... I'll have to get her the Metro by Ogio, she liked that one too. Very nice laptop backpack in every way.!ref!1,1,0
fuzzies up in the race. this all-embracing was beautiful when it arrived and I washed by itself it before use. It stimulate fuzzies wholly over it, plus a bounteous ball of fuzzies in the dryer screen. I tried washing it again and using a different brand of dryer sheet and still fuzzies and another ball of fuzzies in the dryer screen. I tried using a tape roller on it (like for pet hair), it got some of the fuzzies but not all of them. but of course they come off and stick to my clothes! I will try putting this in the dryer again on no heat, to try to get the fuzzies off.this is too bad. I've purchased from Warm Things in the past and had good things to say. this blanket is a real dud. assuming i can't get the fuzzies off with an hour in the dryer on cool i will be contacting Warm Things to see if i can return this.UPDATE: Warm Things allowed me to return this item. Fantastic customer service!! Absolutely would order from them again.!ref!0,1,1

fall through you ilk water. Tori's music is always reflective of her life, like any artist. At the same time, an artist continually explores technique to add to their base of knowledge. Tori always injects these things into her music...that is what makes her the great artist that she is. To Venus and Back...the new material...is more about atmosphere than clear expression of emotion ... more evident on Little Earthquakes. I like the fact that the words and their meanings are not so immediate...they too become atmospheric. She is masterful at the use and combinations of sounds and uses her voice more instrumentally here. I am a big fan, and this recording (live set is excellent too... those pining for "the old Tori" will appreciate it) is as great as all her other ones.!ref!1,1,0
foiled. The Descent is one of my favorite films by far. I was surprised when a sequel was announced. To me, the first film (uncut version) resolved everything. My greatest fears were confirm when I finally got to watch The Descent Part 2 over the weekend.What were they believe! result well enough unequalled!!ref!0,1,1
